A quick blog post about things learned and accomplished in 2014 and areas of focus for 2015.

By writing them down I hope thereâ€™s more chance of me actually following through.

<h4>Goals for 2014</h4>
A look back at some areas of focus I set myself <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/2014-goals/">this time last year</a>.

<strong>1. Projects with (sustainable) business models</strong>. Fail. Continued to work on side-projects that I enjoy to work on, rather than those that make money. What can I say, I enjoy hacking and tinkering on stuff. However I did manage to shut down and/or sell a few websites that I felt weren't going anywhere, freeing up some time.

<strong><del>2. Hardware</del></strong>. Success(ish). Took a couple of classes at Techshop in San Francisco where I built and programmed my first Arduino. My Kano also arrived so I can devote some more time to it. I definitely have a better understanding of how this stuff works, but have a long way to go before building something useful.

<strong><del>3. Educating others</del></strong>. Success. I was a mentor and talked at Lean Startup Machine SF, mentored at Startup Weekend Oakland, gave a couple of Tech Talks on the things I do at Mailgun and wrote a couple of tutorials.

<strong><del>4. Educating myself</del></strong>. Success. Read quite a few useful books. Started Krav Maga training. Started Crossfit classes. Attended a Cooper workshop on design leadership. Took a couple of Techshop classes on electronics, and some development classes on both Code School and Treehouse.

Bonus: <strong><del>Start a family</del></strong>. Success. Very proud to say my wife and I had a son in November. Life now has a whole new meaning, and also affects my areas of focus going forward :-)


<h4>Areas of focus for 2015</h4>

<strong>1. Focus on doing less</strong>. Instead of spreading myself thin and working on lots of things, I plan to focus. This includes projects I take on in work, personal projects and things in my personal life. By being selective I hope I can be more successful at the things I do take on.

<strong>2. Investing and wealth management</strong>. I'm a noob to what I'll call "wealth management". Investing. Stocks. Real estate. Lots to learn here. Now that I have a family I want to have a better understanding of this area of life so I can invest in the future.

<strong>3. Writing</strong>. I enjoy writing about the things I learn. And I find I learn more when I write or teach. More how-to tutorials, talking at events, hosting work shops, writing a book, teaching in schools. Something along those lines.

Have a good 2015.
