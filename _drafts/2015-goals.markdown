A quick blog post about things learned and accomplished in 2014 and areas of focus for 2015.

By writing them down I hope thereâ€™s more chance of me actually following through.

<h4>New software/apps/tools for 2014</h4>
Some of these apps I had used before, but in 2013 I found myself becoming more reliant on them and working them into my daily routine.

<h4>Goals for 2014</h4>
A look back at some areas of focus I set myself <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/2014-goals/">this time last year</a>.

<strong>1. Projects with (sustainable) business models</strong>. Fail. Continued to work on side-projects that I enjoy to work on, rather than those making me money. However I did manage to shut down and/or sell a few websites that weren't going anywher, freeing up some time.

<strong><del>2. Hardware</del></strong>. Success(ish). Took a couple of classes at Techshop in San Francisco where I built and programmed my first Arduino. My Kano also arrived so I can devote some more time to it. I definitely have a better understanding of how this stuff works, but have a long way to go before building something useful.

<strong><del>3. Educating others</del></strong>. Success. I was a mentor and talked at Lean Startup Machine SF, mentored at Startup Weekend Oakland, gave a couple of Tech Talks on the things I do at Mailgun and wrote a couple of tutorials.

<strong><del>4. Educating myself</del></strong>. Success. Read quite a few useful books. Took up Krav Maga. Started Crossfit classes. Attended a Cooper workshop on design leadership. Took a couple of Techshop classes. Took some classes on both Code School and Treehouse.

Bonus: <strong><del>Become a father</del></strong>. Success. Very proud to say my wife and I had a son in November, Jack Munroe. Life now has a whole new meaning :-)


<h4>Areas of focus for 2015</h4>

<strong>1. Focus</strong>


<strong>2. Wealth management</strong>


<strong>3. Educating others</strong>
More how-to tutorials, a more focused blog, talking at events, hosting work shops, writing a book, teaching in schools. Something along those lines.

<strong>4. Educating myself</strong> 
There are a tone of great online courses available now, and in person workshops, lots of which have been on my to-do list for too long. Time to set aside some time to do them. 

Have a good 2015.
