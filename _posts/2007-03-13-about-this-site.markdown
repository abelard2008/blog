    the fresh and clean design, its uniqueness and the clarity. I'm a young and enthusiastic
    webdesigner and I hope to achieve your level one day.

  content: Hey, love your website, looks fantastic. Its the same type of site I am
    hoping for once I get round to it. Something bright , colourful, has a non-serious
    theme to it but still delivers the message of being a designer :) Have you looked
    at the site in IE7 by the way as it seems that tehre could be a problem with background-repeat
    fro the top background image and a div closing too soon causing a problem with
    the footer. Hope I'm helping!

  content: Yes George, I designed the icons in Photoshop. A combination of the shape
    and pen tool while keeping the paths is a great way of allowing you to play around
    with different shapes.

    Cheers Steve, yeah it's Wordpress. Used to have my own but Wordpress is so handy and powerful I thought there was no point trying to re-invent the wheel.

This site was first developed for a University assignment in early 2007. Since then, I have developed it further into what you see today and now use it as my main portfolio site available at leemunroe.com.

The site has been developed Web Standards compliant. You can read more about Web Standards at <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">www.webstandards.org</a>. It is best viewed with the most latest versions of browsers:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx">Internet Explorer 7</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.firefox.com/">Firefox 2</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari (Mac)</a></li>
</ul>
If you do not currently have the above installed, I recommend you do as earlier versions of these browsers lack some CSS support and PNG support and if you are using an earlier version of Internet Explorer you will currently not be viewing the whole website.

(NB: the site should be viewable on all browsers but I still recommend upgrading as they are free and provide better web design support)

Throughout the day I have different website themes in the form of Day, Sunset and Night. Therefore if you view the site at 10pm, the night theme will be active.
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/themes.jpg" alt="Themes throughout the day" /></p>
As this is started as a University assignment, you may see references to my assignments and major project. You can just ignore this, or alternatively, you can browse and see what I am currently up to at University.

Enjoy the site.
