Check it out, go to <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.live.com/">Microsoft Live</a> and search for 'web designer northern ireland' and as of 18th March 2007 you'll see my name listed in the top spot. Okay, so we all know Google is top dog for search engines, but getting up there in Yahoo and Live is a start.

Yahoo search results for 'web designer northern ireland'Since the second half of 2006 I have realised the importance of the combination of well structured markup XHTML and CSS. These, along with the key positioning of keywords within the site content, are the fundamental factors for my website moving up the rankings and these key factors are implemented in all the websites I design and develop.
