<h5>What is an RSS Feed?</h5>
RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication and enables you, the user, to sign up to different blogs, news feeds and podcasts that saves you from having to visit all your favourite sites each time you want to check for an update.

The majority of large news websites now have RSS Feeds and they are usually identified by the following icons.

<h5>How does it work?</h5>
To start, you need a news aggregator (also known as a RSS reader), which will check and download all the RSS Feeds you sign up to, and will inform you if there has been an update. There are various aggregators available - I recommend using <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">Newsgator</a> as it's free and takes 2min to register. Your browser may also allow you to sign up to RSS Feeds.
<h5>How can you sign up to my RSS Feed?</h5>
I have 1 RSS Feed available, which is my Blog. By clicking the link below, you will be brought to my feed. Your browser may allow you to sign up to it from there, alternatively, from <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">Newsgator</a> you can easily add a feed by entering in the location of the feed. In my case, the location is <strong>http://feeds.feedburner.com/LeeMunroeBlog</strong>
