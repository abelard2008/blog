I came across this website recently called N.Design. It's the blog and portfolio of a guy named Nick La. I was taken away by the initial illustration, used as the background of the site, and by diving deeper into Nick's portfolio you can see more fantastic art work.

Nick's work has been featured in many issues of <a href="http://webdesignermag.co.uk/">Web Designer</a> magazine along with <a href="http://www.computerarts.co.uk/">Computer Arts</a> magazine. He offers fantastic tutorials on Illustrator and offers great downloadable resources that I would recommend to any web designers to take a look at. His blogs very interesting too.

Take a look and see for yourself.
