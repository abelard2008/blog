Finally after months of research, prototypes and development the deadline date for my major project submission has arrived. This is the major project for my final year of BSc Hons Interactive Multimedia Design - an online sports kit designer intended for sportswear manufacturers.

Users can use the application to design and customise their sports kits by experimenting with different kit parts and colours. Once they are happy with their kit, they can submit it for a quotation, at which point their details along with the kit details are saved to an admin area that can be accessed by the manufacturer.
