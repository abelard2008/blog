If you're anything like me whenever you logon to your computer in the morning there's a million and one things to do and check; check your email, read your subscribed feeds, click the 'inspiration' tag on your del.icio.us page to get inspiration for the day, read the news and search for classic episodes of the Simpsons on YouTube. In the past this would mean opening up many tabs on my browser, but now I have came across <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">NetVibes</a>.

NetVibes is a personalised homepage. It allows you to add various widgets to your homepage including news feeds, weather, search engines and email therefore you have everything you need on just one page. You can even change the theme of your layout. This is the perfect site to get you started for the day and keep you organised.

<a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Click here to visit the site  </a>

NetVibes isn't the only personalised homepage out there. NetVibes would be my personal preference but here's some more you can check out:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.live.com/getstarted.aspx">Live</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/ig?hl=en">iGoogle</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.pageflakes.com/">PageFlakes</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.webwag.com/">Webwag</a></li>
</ul>
