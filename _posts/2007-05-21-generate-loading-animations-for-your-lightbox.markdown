I've been  using the beloved <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lightbox</a> for a galleries quite a lot lately. You can't beat for ease of use, keeping the site tidy and beats using annoying pop-up enlargements. However, I don't like using the default buttons and loading animation as obviously the effort should be made to brand it like the rest of the site. Buttons are no problem, they're easily designed in Photoshop, but I've always had a problem creating animations in Image Ready, it seems to take me longer than it really should and it's hard to come up with loading ideas. That's until I came across this nifty site that creates loading animations for you on the fly, called <a href="http://www.ajaxload.info/">AjaxLoad</a>.

This is a great tool for creating custom loading animations and generates them in 2 seconds. Just select the type of animation you want and its colours and generate it. Saves a lot of flaffing about in ImageReady and trying to make a simple graphic. I recommend it.
