Once again it's the end of another University year and fellow graduate designers around the world are now seeking new jobs and new challenges. This is also the case at the University of Ulster for the Interactive Multimedia Design crowd who, including myself, have just completed around the clock work on their major projects and are awaiting their reward with graduation in July.

We recently had a degree show in the Belfast campus, showcasing our work to potential employers across the country, which was very successful and ended up with the gathering of a lot of creative business cards.
<p class="blogimg" align="center"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/cards.jpg" alt="Cards" /></p>
Over the 4 years of our degree, we've been shaped into talented web designers, graphic designers, 3d modelers and application developers and the end result has been a collection of amazing final year projects. Apart from my own project, <a href="http://kit.meout.net/" title="Kit Me Out">Kit Me Out</a>, I have listed 5 of my favorites below that I think are interesting and are well put together.
<h5>Shake Hands with a Stranger</h5>
