Since the launch of my new website in January 07, there have been a number of contributors to the traffic that the site receives. Incoming links from other websites isn't just good because it gets you a potential visitor, it also works well with Google's ranking system as it sees each link to your site as a vote and therefore it can improve your search engine listing.

Thanks to the sites/magazines below for linking/listing my website. A lot of these sites are galleries for well designed websites so if you're a web designer like myself, or if you just have a generally well designed website, I recommend submitting your site to some of the lists as it doesn't hurt to have as many incoming links as possible. They're great for getting inspiration as well.
