Haven't written anything here for a while now so thought I'd give a brief update on some of the things I've been up to.
<h5>Summer holiday</h5>
Have been on holiday to the USA for a couple of weeks. Had a great time visiting Chicago, Orlando and Miami. Chicago has great architecture and seems to be a very busy city. Went to my first baseball game to watch the White Sox, which was good craic. Did the whole Disney and Universal thing in Orlando and then some relaxing time on the beaches of Miami that has some top notch night clubs.
<h5>Work, work, work</h5>
Back to <a href="http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=845&amp;ArticleID=1324694">porridge</a> now though and I have a few big projects that I'm working on at the minute that I hope to have launched shortly.

I recently revamped <a href="http://www.royalhotelbangor.com/">The Royal Hotel</a> website, however you'll notice that it still looks the same. The management wanted to get the site further up the search engines with some key phrases but wanted to keep the design in tact. So I ripped apart the code that I had originally programmed a few years back and tidied it up with CSS and XHTML using my knowledge of web standards. The results have been great after just 1 month, with phrases like 'hotel northern ireland' and 'hotel bangor' working up the ranks of Google and Yahoo.
