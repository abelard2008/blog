Was checking out the Simpsons movie website the other day and noticed they have an application for making your own Simpsons characters. See what you'd look like on the set of Springfield, compared to the likes of Moe, Smithers and of course Homer. There's a lot of characteristics to choose from so you should be able to get a reasonable resemblance.

Simply go to <a href="http://www.simpsonsmovie.com/main.html">www.simpsonsmovie.com/main.html</a> and click on 'Create your Simpsons avatar'.
