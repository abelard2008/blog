I recently designed a new fresh and modern layout for Green Energy Solutions. Over the last year Green Energy have had much success and are rapidly expanding therefore their website needs to reflect the professionalism that the company offers, look interesting to potential customers and have all information easy to access.
<p class="blogimg" align="center"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/greennew.jpg" alt="Green Energy" /></p>
The key to the new site was to make things simple, have the information that the user wanted available at the click of the button. And for those who could not find what they were looking for, a Google integrated search facility, which not only searches through the web pages, but searches through any additional pdf documents also.

The new design is web standards based (CSS &amp; XHTML), which compared to the old site (designed with HTML tables) allows for a greater range of accessibility and gives some meaning to the data structure which is important for SEO. New high resolution photographs were taken by freelance photographer <a href="http://www.numeronineo.com/">Ronan Murphy</a> to give the user a better and more detailed view of the products and services that Green Energy have to offer.

A new admin area has been added to allow the client to keep the site up-to-date as they would like and a dealer back-end system has also been developed to allow dealers to login and order parts, download technical pdfs and download marketing material. The client is now also able to add dealer locations and contact details to a Google Map integrated into the dealers page.
