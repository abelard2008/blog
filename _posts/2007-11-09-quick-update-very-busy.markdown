Thought I'd give a quick update as I haven't said anything in a while.

Very busy these days with Masters course and finishing up a couple of big projects that I started over the summer. Made a few changes to the site to make it a bit more user friendly. I've been reading a couple of good <strong>usability books</strong>:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0321344758?&amp;camp=2486&amp;creative=8874&amp;linkCode=wey&amp;tag=leemunroe-21"><span class="sans">Don't Make Me Think!</span></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0321350316?&amp;camp=2486&amp;creative=8874&amp;linkCode=wey&amp;tag=leemunroe-21"><span class="sans">Prioritizing Web Usability</span></a></li>
	<li><span class="sans"><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/073571410X?&amp;camp=2486&amp;creative=8882&amp;linkCode=wey&amp;tag=leemunroe-21">Defensive Design For The Web</a>
</span></li>
</ul>
From this I'm making my sites more 'user friendly' and ensuring my designs are easily understood at a glance.

Was at an interesting talk a few weeks back with <strong>Sir John Hegarty</strong> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Bogle_Hegarty">Bartle Bogle Hegarty</a>, a highly respected advertising agency in the U.K. Some of their clients include British Airways, Audi, Levis and one of the ads he showed us was this Levis ad below, which I hadn't seen in years and thought it was pretty cool.
