I've been making several changes to the site recently.

As you may have noticed the layout has slightly changed (but not much). Just my way of making the information more <strong>accessible</strong>.

I've <strong>restructured the pages</strong>. Basically each page no longer has the file extension (i.e. .asp). This is to <strong>future proof</strong> the site, so that down the line if I decide to switch programming languages, it will be a lot handier to apply. For example, if I decided to convert my site from asp to php then you, the user, wouldn't be affected as all the pages would be in the same locations therefore bookmarks and search engines will still work.

I've been introduced to <strong>Wordpress</strong>, and am now using it as my blog engine. I know I know, I'm about 2 years behind, but I started using Wordpress for a project recently and couldn't believe how easy to use it was and how powerful it was. I can't believe I haven't looked at it until now. And there's an endless amount of plugins available so that makes things very handy and saves me a lot of programming time and effort. Thanks to Small Potato @ <a href="http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/02/19/so-you-want-to-create-wordpress-themes-huh/">WP Designer</a> for the easy to follow, step by step tutorial on designing themes for Wordpress. Web Designer Wall also offers some good Wordpress tips. Here's a couple of useful Wordpress links:
