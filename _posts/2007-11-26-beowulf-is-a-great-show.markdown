I recently went to see Beowulf at the cinema - actually went to see it by mistake as there was a mix up with times for 'American Gangster' so wasn't too sure what I was going to make of it, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The <strong>story </strong>is based on an old English poem and is a bit strange with sea monsters and dragons but it's enjoyable to watch.

The <strong>3D animation</strong> is absolutely amazing and there were times I forgot that it was 3D due to the realism. Specifically the characters, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich &amp; Angeline Jolie look 100% like themselves. Ray Winstone not so much, but he does a great voice as Beowulf. His 3D appearance actually reminded me a bit of Sean Bean at times.
