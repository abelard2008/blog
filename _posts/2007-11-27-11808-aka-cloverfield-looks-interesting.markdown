Seen a poster for this movie a couple of months back and wondered what it was. The movie wasn't given a name, but was marketed as its release date: 01-18-08.

A trailer has recently been released and on reading up on it, it seems to be a monster movie i.e. a monster appears and causes havoc in New York City. The film is delivered documentary style from a group of friends (rather like The Blair Witch Project).

According to <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3id4ef5b33280f855a6076329c1ca10481">hollywoodreporter.com</a> the whole movie synopsis was kept secret and mysterious to generate some viral interest. Looks like it could be interesting. Check out the trailer below.
