If you're a web designer you know how hard it is to get your design to look perfect across all the different browsers available; Firefox, IE, Safari, Opera etc. When it comes to designing for html email, it can be even more nightmarish.

Introducing the Email Standards Project. A project setup to encourage best practice standards &amp; CSS support across the major email clients including AOL, Apple, Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo etc.

I think it's a great idea and hopefully these email clients will take heed. Click the link below for more information.
