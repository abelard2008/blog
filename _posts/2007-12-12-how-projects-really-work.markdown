Very amusing illustration from <a href="http://www.projectcartoon.com">ProjectCartoon.com</a> showing how different people involved in a project understand things differently. Check it out at <a href="http://www.projectcartoon.com/cartoon/1">www.projectcartoon.com/cartoon/1</a> and you can even make your own and edit the captions.
