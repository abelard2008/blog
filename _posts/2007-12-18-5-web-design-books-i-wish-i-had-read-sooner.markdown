    @Harry Roberts
    Yeah I've read CSS Mastery before and it has a few good tips. Web Standards Creativity looks good, I'll have to get a look at that

    Bulletproof Web Design by Dan Cederholm - http://www.simplebits.com/publications/bulletproof/
    is a book I really enjoyed and teaches some simple but effective techniques.
    Another book I would certainly recommend is Transcending CSS by Andy Clarke. - http://www.transcendingcss.com/
    Here you will learn to visualize mark up and begin to learn more about CSS 3 selectors.
    The only trouble is, (after reading this book) that when reading a magazine or newspaper, the mind tends to see definition lists and unordered lists all over the page, so a magazine magically becomes one big book of mark-up (am I making any sense?)
     :-)
    I am waiting patiently for someone to publish the definitive book on semantics and microformats. Jeremy Keith maybe?

    Good choices BTW :-)

I never used to be one for books, but that was until my last year as an under-grad when I realised how influential and useful design related books could be to my work. A year and a bit on now, I've read loads of books and continue to do so, taking something new from each.

Below is a list of 5 books that I wish I had read sooner than I did, as they have such an impact on my design approach and thinking.

<strong>When I read this: </strong><strong>October 2006</strong>

If you're a web designer then you should know and be using CSS to design websites by now. If you're using tables to design websites or just starting off, this is a simple easy to read and understand book for beginners.
