    Great site Lee!

    Quite liked the movie, did the whole 'suspense' thing well and some realistic moments.

    However, I didn't care too much for the characters or why they were trying to save Beth. Rob seems on a personal quest for romantic satisfaction at a time of public calamity. The young actors were pretty nasty too tbh, they talk like people in twentysomething dramas.

    Good film for the YouTube generation I guess.

    @Michael

    Thanks mate.

    lol yeah, the whole 'love quest' thing was a bit strange, it added a bit of cheesiness to the story, but I suppose they had to have some sort of plot along with the whole 'monster' thing.

Back in November <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/index.php/2007/11/27/11808-aka-cloverfield-looks-interesting/">I blogged about Cloverfield</a>, produced by J.J. Abrams (the 'Lost' guy), and the release has finally come to the UK.

Cloverfield is a monster movie, similar to the likes of Godzilla, but is filmed from the point of view of a hand held camera, similar to The Blair Witch Project. We see the film through the eyes of a party of 5 people who are in New York when the monster attacks and the movie is about them trying to survive.

It's definitely worth a watch and the amateur style photography adds to the authenticity of it all so you easily get seduced into thinking the movie is real. There's even talk of a sequel to the movie.

I found some artwork of the monster over at <a href="http://wayangtopia.com/cloverfield/cloverfield-fan-art-monster/">wayangtopia.com/cloverfield/cloverfield-fan-art-monster/</a>, check it out below.
