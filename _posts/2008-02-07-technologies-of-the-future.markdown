    @John B
    Yeah I did, some neat stuff all right. Started watching '2057 - The City'. Some interesting ideas in it (holographic companions? a liking to 'The Golden Compass')

  content: "When I first red an article about Nanobots in the 1975 issue of Time Magazine
    It re sparked my futuristic interest. \r\nThe first Picture I viewed was a far
    more simplified version compared to the photos of today.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke of
    the bots, most people thought I was whacked. \r\nBack then the average educated
    person was afraid to even think such a thing was possible.\r\nI have been following
    the Bots growth for 37 years now.\r\nToday the word nanobots is widely used but
    does the average Joe really know what they are capable of? \r\nI have red nothing
    so far about the renegades. Are they under control yet?\r\n\r\nToday technology
    is running ramped! Much of it is good. \r\nHay we where promised the bots would
    make all computers fast as the blink of an eye where is it?\r\n\r\nThe predicted
    technologies of the future are amazing! But should we not slow it down a bit and
    try to perfect the Nanobots for the good of mankind.\r\n Do we really need cameras
    in our eyes?\r\n Are we to lazy to charge our phones at home? \r\nInformation
    on the net now is hard to decipher truth from fix ion."

I came across an interesting article recently on the Sky news website showcasing several predicted technologies of the future and am amazed at some of the stuff that's in the pipeline.

<h5>1. Digital eye</h5>
<p><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/frog.jpg" alt="Frog" /></p>
<p>Cameras will be small enough to insert into the eye (like a contact lens). Not only will you be able to take pictures wherever you go, users will be able to login into your sight, with the powers of Wi-Fi, and you'll be able to share your vision with the world.</p>

<h5>2.  Smart clothes</h5>
<p><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/smartclothes.jpg" alt="Smart Clothes" /></p>
<p>Forgot your phone charger again? It's alright because you'll be able to charge your phone with your clothes. Micro generators embedded in your clothes will allow for your movements to turn into power, even enough to give an attacker a small electric shock.</p>

<h5>3. Digital graffiti</h5>
<p><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/graffiti.jpg" alt="Graffiti" /></p>
<p>Leave your mark anywhere in the world without leaving a stain with this digital spray can.</p>

<h5>4. Nanobots everywhere</h5>
<p><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/nanobots.jpg" alt="Nanobots" /></p>
<p>It is predicted that in the future we will have nanobots injected into our bodies. Introducing the 'Nano door', a door that when you walk through, you can program your body-sculpting nanobots. Woke up too late to have a shave? Shave yourself in 1 second. Going for a walk on the beach? Add some skin treads to your feet to make it easier to walk.</p>

<h5>5.  First life</h5>
<p><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/cctv.jpg" alt="First life" /></p>
<p>Taking Second Life into the real world, by wearing a holographic monocle you can have the social community website feel on the street by viewing people's stats, avatars, preferences, hates etc.</p>
