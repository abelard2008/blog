    @Mike
    Like learning any new language there were moments when I wanted to throw the laptop out the window :-) but I'm glad I stuck at it and am a lot more confident with it now.

    Its good as it cuts down the amount of coding you have to do (compared to ASP/PHP) and there's a lot of help out there within the Ruby on Rails community and a lot of plugins available so you don't need to code everything.

    It took me a while getting my head around the framework/environment but I'd definitely look into it if you have an hour to spare.

  content: Excellent idea.  Seems to be catching on quickly...do you think the press
    will pick it up?

I'm very excited about a project that I just I've just launched, <a href="http://www.thebigwordproject.com">The Big Word Project</a>. The project is about redefining words with websites. You select a word that best represents your website and then link it to your site. Simple.

I've launched this project with <a href="http://www.paddydonnelly.net">Paddy Donnelly</a>, a fellow Masters student. We both needed a project to experiment with the skills we've developed through our course and this seemed like the perfect project to do so. While Paddy has been researching viral marketing, I have been looking at web applications and usability.

<!--more-->

The site was developed using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, a programming language &amp; framework that I have been learning and it's great to finally get something launched after working on it night and day for the past month.

Please visit <a href="http://www.thebigwordproject.com">www.thebigwordproject.com</a> and check it out. You can buy words for $1 per letter and link them to your site, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.bebo.com">bebo</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com">myspace </a>or <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr </a>accounts. Keep track of our progress on <a href="http://blog.thebigwordproject.com">The Big Word Project Blog</a>.

I appreciate the support and any feedback you'd like to offer.
