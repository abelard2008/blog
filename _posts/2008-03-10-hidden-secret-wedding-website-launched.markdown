    Well done, looks a million dollars!

    How long did this one take you to work on?

    What did you use?

    So many questions, so little time :)

    Cheers mate, it came together really well, very pleased with it.

    Took 3 months from the agreed proposal to the launch of the site. Usual "Technologies used" - Illustrator, Photoshop, Flash, Dreamweaver (hand coded). Used Wordpress for the blog.

    Hey Lee,
    That's a really nice site. Hows things going with the MA? We're handing in are major project next wk, bet you remember that last year. Stressful times.
    The reason I'm leaving a comment here is I want to ask you how you hide the .php with /folder. I have been trying to figure this out for weeks on Dreamhost and realise it mod_rewrite but do you have any useful tips.

    @ryan
    O yes, this time last year I was frantically trying to get my kit designer to work. Let me know when yours is up and running.

    Yeah, mod-rewrite is how to do it but to be honest I've never done it before as I use a lot of asp and now Ruby on Rails (which is really easy to customise urls). I hunted out these links from my delicious that I saved ages ago and hope they'll help - they seem pretty useful.

    Good luck!
