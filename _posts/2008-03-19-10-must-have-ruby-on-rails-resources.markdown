    Hi Lee!
    Is it easier than php? I fancy a dabble with it.

    The Cardiff Geeks group I belong to are trying to start a little ROR sub group and I will try and fish some ROR links for you. The only one I can remember off hand is
    <a href="http://heroku.com/" rel="nofollow">Heroku.com</a>

    Cheers

    @Johnny
    I'd say there's less actual programming required on your part, although it did take me a while to get my head around the MVC framework.

    Just checked out Heroku - fantastic! Had a quick dabble around and it looks great, you can easily build rails apps through their site. Definitely worth trying out for beginners.

    Hmm, don't know about that just yet. I love the handiness of Wordpress. Although as DHH shows us it <a href="http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov" rel="nofollow">wouldn't take much effort to develop a simple blog in rails</a>.

I thought I'd share some of the most useful resources that I found extremely helpful.

Let me know if there's anymore that are worth looking at; I still consider myself a noob when it comes to RoR and could do with a lot more training and resources.
