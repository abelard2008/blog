    I was so up for going to this but in the end I didn't have enough money to get a ticket, travel, etc.

    I'm sure you'll have a great time at it, looks like there's some really awesome speakers and topics :)

<a href="http://www.futureofwebdesign.com">FOWD </a>is going to London next week (17th &amp; 18th April) and am happy to say I'll be attending. This will be my first big web event and am exited to hear the speakers and meet with different web designers out there.

<h6>What is FOWD?</h6>
Future Of Web Design (FOWD) is a conference organised by <a href="http://www.carsonified.com">Carsonified</a>. It's one of those 'geeky' web conferences that us web designers think are really cool and some of the biggest names in the business will be attending and speaking.

If you're heading to it give me a shout.
