    How about handing a project over to a client and they decide to make changes using Dreamweavers' 'design view' inserting inline CSS styles, break tags etc etc resulting in a bloated page with invalid mark up. This has happened to me :-(

    Also those annoying JavaScript web counters that display how many visitors have come to their site. Doh!

    a nice site.

    @Johnny lol yes, the counters that everyone always starts at 10,000 so people think they're popular

    @Dave Yikes! It's one of those situations where you try to educate the client or just give in to what they want. Don't give in Dave!

    Ha Ha. Takes me back to the early days of web design, when sites were full of animated gif's.

    Frontpage and Frontpage extensions - what a headache they were.

    Hit counters were also abundant!

    websites that were created in Frontpage. I can honestly say that I have never
    used Frontpage in my 12+ years of web development. That might be a feat in and

    I don't think it has ever been logical to actually push a visitor somewhere else

    I wouldn't just put target=\"_blank\" on any outgoing link.\r\n\r\nNow I have
    to admit with browser tabs it isn't as bad now, but a whole new browser window
    is very annoying. There's a good article on the topic here. http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/01/should-links-open-in-new-windows/"

  content: "You know, I'm a developer and not a designer. Yet I tell you, there is
    nothing more frustrating than using DIV's for layout. This piece of junky idea
    called DIV, will not go and stay any direction I want it to go.\r\n\r\nTry create
    a bordered DIV container filling a page 100% that changes with the browser re-size.
    Wow! What a complex piece of engineering that is. You need a rocket scientist
    as the W3C luminaries cannot provide a workable solution. Try also find a hack
    online and you are going to spend hours and hours. Try understand CSS layout and
    you need a degree. \r\n\r\nI am telling you, layout concepts are so trivial in
    the desktop side is not even funny to compare. \r\n\r\nOr maybe you tell me I
    have no ability to LEARN CSS layout. Yep. That must be it.\r\n\r\nUsing tables
    for layout is JUST FINE. Get over this purist nonsense."

    probably be working along side a designer who can help design the templates for

    Accessibility, SEO, maintainability, file size, faster loading time and cross
    platform compatibility (e.g. mobile browsers) to name a few.\r\n\r\nTo be honest
    I didn't think this was debatable anymore. CSS is just all around goodness. A

    Interesting read.

    Lee, I'd appreciate your feedback on whether it is ever good to have the definite article, 'The' at the beginning of a web address?  Is it always redundant or are there times, do you think, that it could be ok?

    Regards

    arrows ah
---
<a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/10-old-skool-no-nos-for-web-designers"><img class="left alignleft size-full wp-image-432" style="margin:0 10px 10px 0;" title="Web designer no nos" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/nerd1.jpg" alt="" /></a>I was talking to <a href="http://www.kyleboyd.co.uk">Kyle Boyd</a> recently and we were discussing a website that he was due to revamp. He asked me the question "Guess what they're using?" and I then rhymed off 10 things that, as web designers, we should try and stay away from. So I  thought I'd share the list with you.

<h4>1. Frames</h4>
We've come a long way from the standard frame website. As well as being <strong>poor for usability and SEO</strong>, they generally <strong>look awful</strong> too.
<h4>2. iFrames</h4>
Similar to frames, but these are small embedded frames within the page. If you need something to replicate an iFrame, e.g. a Terms &amp; Conditions box, make use of the <strong>overflow:auto</strong> declaration in CSS.
<!--more-->
<h4>3. Tables</h4>
If you're a web designer and you still use HTML tables to layout a page, then you shouldn't call yourself a web designer. <strong>Get yourself a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1590593812%26tag=leemunroe-21%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1590593812%253FSubscriptionId=1YNZ339ZCHHAKYFSY702">Web Standards/CSS book</a></strong>. Of course using tables to display tabular data is fine.
<h4>4. Animated gifs</h4>
Really old skool websites used to fire a load of animated gifs on a page (I was one of them 10 years ago when first experimenting with web design). They usually <strong>look poor</strong> and more than one can mean there's <strong>too much going on</strong>. They can still look well though if used tastefully (on occasion).
<h4>5. Inline formatting</h4>
If you use something like &lt;font size="12px"&gt; to format the text on your web pages, you'll have a fun time when the client asks for a slightly larger font (and you've got a website with over 1000 pages). Use <strong>external CSS files</strong> to format your designs and content. One amendment changes all.
<h4>6. FrontPage</h4>
I used to use FrontPage years ago and I remember it being a really poor environment to work in, that usually added a lot more code to a page than needed. I don't know if it's any better now, but in general it still seems to be frowned upon by web designers. Microsoft now has <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/overview.aspx?key=web">Expression Web</a>, which I haven't used, but I suspect is much better. I would say <strong><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver</a> is the industry standard</strong> software for web design, but I would recommend <strong>learning XHTML from scratch and hand coding</strong>.
<h4>7. Internet Explorer 6 (or even worse, 5.5)</h4>
Non-web designers don't realise the agro that we go through when we finally get a website looking brand spanking fantastic in one browser (usually Firefox in my case) then we do the inevitable browser test in IE6 and the website is a mess. Remember to <strong>check your work in at least Firefox, Safari, IE6, IE7 and Opera.</strong> If you're using Internet Explorer, think about using <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> instead, or at least make sure you have the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx">latest version of Explorer (7)</a>.
<h4>8. Pop-up windows</h4>
I hate pop-up windows. Pop-up adverts and notices are even worse. If you must insist on a pop-up/fullscreen website, at least <strong>offer an alternative</strong> link for a normal window or look at <strong><a href="http://www.orangoo.com/labs/GreyBox/">Javascript work-a-rounds</a></strong>.
<h4>9. New windows</h4>
I prefer to have control over how many windows and tabs I have open in my browser, I don't like the website deciding for me. Using <strong>target="_blank" </strong>launches a new window but disrupts the users experience, so <strong>try not to use it</strong>. I have to admit though that I still use it myself the odd time, if linking to an external website from a clients site (but I'm trying not to).
<h4>10.  Flash intro pages</h4>
This one really <strong>depends on your target market</strong> and the <strong>purpose </strong>of the website. If you really want to impress the pants off someone on a one off experience (e.g., a website for a new movie) then you can get away with it. But if you're looking <strong>repeat visits </strong>then a flash intro page will most likely <strong>turn users away</strong>, as it acts like a barrier to the main content (and also poor for SEO). If required, <strong>consider including the Flash intro into the homepage </strong>of the site, surrounded by the content and navigation, just as <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a> do.

<h4>World's Worst Website</h4>
I'm not saying you shouldn't ever use any of these points,but as a general rule of thumb I think it's safe to say you should try and stay away from most of them.
<p align="center"><a title="Worlds Worst Website" href="http://www.angelfire.com/super/badwebs/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/frames.jpg" alt="Frames" /></a></p>

Oh, and it turned out they had used FrontPage and FrontPage extensions.

If you've any other tips, send them through below.
