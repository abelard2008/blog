    wanted to see what sites like deviantART looked like before she joined. I might

How have websites changed throughout the years? I've been involved in web design for about 9 years now and here's a look at how 5 of the sites that I regularly visit have changed throughout the years.

This post was inspired by <a href="http://www.wakeuplater.com/website-building/evolution-of-websites-10-popular-websites.aspx">The Evolution of Websites: How 10 Popular Websites Have (And Have Not) Changed</a> (I've kept my list to British sites).
