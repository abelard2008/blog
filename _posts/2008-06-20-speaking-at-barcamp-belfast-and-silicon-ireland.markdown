Just a quick post to let you know that I'm speaking at a couple of forthcoming events in Belfast and Dublin.
<h4>Barcamp Belfast</h4>
<p align="center"><a href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBelfast"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/barcamp.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

Barcamp is happening on <strong>Saturday 21st June 9-5.30ish @ Queens in Belfast</strong>. If you're in Northern Ireland/Ireland you should definitely come along. Barcamp is one of those events where anyone and everyone can talk at and it's completely free to attend (I hear there might be pizza and beer available too thanks to the sponsors).

I've put my name down here to talk about 'Something web designy', which will have a web usability angle on it.

Find out more info on <a href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBelfast">http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBelfast</a>.

You should be able to watch the event live <a href="http://www.mogulus.com/barcampbelfast">http://www.mogulus.com/barcampbelfast</a>
<h6>Silicon Ireland</h6>
Silicon Ireland is happening <strong>Thursday 26th June 9-4.30ish @ City North Hotel in Dublin</strong>. This will be aimed at startups and will bring together people to share their knowledge on this matter. <a href="http://www.paddydonnelly.net">Paddy Donnelly</a> and I have been asked to come along to talk about <a href="http://www.thebigwordproject.com">The Big Word Project</a>, which we're looking forward to.

CrunchLudd, a TechCrunch and TechLudd mashup, is also happening in Dublin that night, after Silicon Ireland, 7.30pm 4 Dame Lane, Dublin.

Find out more info on <a href="http://siliconireland.blogspot.com/">http://siliconireland.blogspot.com/</a>

I hope to post up my slides from each talk so I'll keep in touch. See you at the events.
