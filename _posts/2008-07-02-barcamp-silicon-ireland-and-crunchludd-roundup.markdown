  content: Congratulations for Barcamp, Silicon Ireland and CrunchLudd
---
I've attended <a href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBelfast">Barcamp Belfast</a>, <a href="http://siliconireland.blogspot.com/">Silicon Ireland</a> and <a href="http://www.techludd.com/">CrunchLudd</a> over the last couple of weeks. All were good fun and interesting and it's great to see so much creativeness coming out of Ireland as a whole.
<h4>Barcamp Belfast</h4>
This event was good craic and was great to meet and talk to loads of local people with shared interests. Well done to <a href="http://goodonpaper.org">Andy</a> for a well organised event.

I did a talk at the event entitled 'Keeping users happy' that included some usability and customer relation tips. You can view the slides below (might follow up with a blog post dedicated to this so it makes more sense).

There was an interesting talk on scaling Rails by <a href="http://www.davidjrice.co.uk/">David Rice</a> and a freelance talk by <a href="http://www.freshideas.ie/">Brian O'Neil</a>. All the talks were great but I these were the ones that most applied to me.
<h4>Silicon Ireland</h4>
<a href="http://www.paddydonnelly.net">Paddy Donnelly</a> and I were down talking about <a href="http://www.thebigwordproject.com">The Big Word Project</a> in Dublin. Great day and great people at the event. It was really interesting listening to <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com">Sean McGrath</a>, he has some really interesting ideas regarding the current state of the web. We even got to do a TV <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0627/newsspecial.html">spot for RTE news</a>. Here's an interview we recorded on the day.

<h6>CrunchLudd</h6>
After Silicon Ireland it was onto a (free)bar in Dublin to see some local startups. Some fantastic sites, some have been launched and some are launching shortly. Here's my 2 picks of the bunch.
<h6><a href="http://www.toddle.ie">Toddle.ie</a></h6>

<p>Beautifully designed app that creates mail/newsletter templates with ease</p>

<p>Kind of a mash-up between (old-skool)MTV and YouTube. They have some big labels signed up already.</p>
<p>I had great fun attending all these events and thanks to all the organisers. Hope to see you at the next one.</p>
