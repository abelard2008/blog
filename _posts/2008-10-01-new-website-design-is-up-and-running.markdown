  content: Hey Lee, nice redesign. Any wordpress plugins you could recommend for using
    wordpress as a CMS? The way my work section works on my site is it is just links
    linking to a page and I could do with finding a more elegant solution.

  content: '@Tommy Just by using different page templates and categories you can get
    a pretty good CMS framework from Wordpress. e.g. I have a portfolio category,
    which separates my blog posts and portfolio posts. I plan on writing a couple
    of useful Wordpress posts over the next couple weeks which should help'

  content: "Hi Lee,\r\n\r\nI love the new site. Very professional looking yet functional
    too. I've just put together my first website as a way to showcase my work. I did
    it in notepad and had to learn the ropes as I went but I'm happy with the result.
    I graduated from Visual Communication at the art college in Belfast so I'm more
    of a graphic designer than web designer. Have a look at my site if you get a chance
    and let me know if you have any suggestions. I'd love a site as good as yours!"

I've been working on this new design for roughly 5 months now, in between University and client work (usually when I'm on the train with no internet access). After 3 different versions I've finally launched the site. The new site has been developed using Wordpress and hopefully the new design brings a new freshness to the site.

Like with any other client/project, I started off by asking myself what I wanted to achieve with a new website, who am I targeting, why do users come to my website etc.? I didn't just pretty up the design for the sake of it, there was a process and strategy behind the project.

<!--more-->

Here's a quick overview of how I set out with some requirements analysis:

<h4>What do I like about my current site?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Well crafted, nice design</li>
<li>Ranks well for key search terms e.g. "Web Design Northern Ireland"</li>
<li>Showcases my work well</li>
<li>Easy to use, clear</li>
<li>Blog has roughly 40 rss subscribers and I get roughly 60 unique hits/day</li>
</ul>
Considering I've been pretty lazy with updates/blogging those stats aren't bad, but could be a lot better.

<h4>What do I not like about my current website?</h4>
<ul>
<li>I don't blog enough</li>
<li>CMS is a bit basic (built it myself)</li>
<li>There isn't enough happening for repeat visits</li>
<li>Would prefer larger portfolio shots</li>
<li>RSS subscribers and daily hits could be better</li>
</ul>
Generally, the site's pretty static - there should be more happening.

<h4>What do I want from this new website?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A place where I can showcase my work to potential clients and continue to get enquiries</li>
<li>To communicate and socialise with the online community, specifically within the web design &amp; Irish online industry scene</li>
<li>Achieve more RSS subscribers &amp; website hits</li>
<li>People to read my blog and get something out of it</li>
<li>To be able to update the site with as little effort as possible - more efficient</li>
</ul>
The new website isn't just about showing off my work, it's about interacting with other creatives, voicing my opinion, sharing knowledge and making the effort to write.

<h4>So what have I done (or will I do) to achieve this?</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Blog more</strong> Make the time to write at least 1 decent blog post per week. Target topics I'm good at and interested in like web design, web apps etc. but also take an interest in what's happening locally in NI.</li>
<li><strong>Sideblog</strong> I've introduced a sideblog 'Elsewhere' that will list any interesting links I come across and hopefully as well as promoting their site, it will help to encourage repeat visits to mine.</li>
<li><strong>Socialise</strong> I want to get to know more creatives out there and tools like Twitter are a great start to getting to know people (I've found that a lot of initial Twitter greetings have turned into real life greetings). Regularly twittering and commenting more on other blogs is a simple but effective way of networking online. I've introduced Twitter and Flickr feeds to help encourage this.</li>
<li><strong>Mini projects</strong> I plan on working on a lot more mini projects. The Big Word Project went really well so it would be great to continue with a few more smaller projects as I work on client work and bigger/better projects.</li>
<li><strong>Wordpress</strong> Wordpress is a great blogging tool and used in the right way it can be a great CMS too, which is what I've used for my new site. This makes things a whole lot handier to manage and there are a tonne of useful plugins available to help achieve certain tasks a lot quicker.</li>
</ol>

This is an overview of how I've came up with what you see today and hopefully I have or will achieve everything I set out to. I'd appreciate any feedback (and definitely appreciate any errors pointed out :).

I better get working on that next blog post :-?
