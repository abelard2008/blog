    to shout ARRRRRRR if they say something about pirating!! Are they going to film
    the talks and put up on youtube or something?\r\n\r\n\r\nNice redesign, I like
    the H&amp;W cranes at the bottom."

The Future of Web Apps is happening in London next week, 8th-10th October, and I'm going to me there. I was at the <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/heading-to-the-future-of-web-design/">Future of Web Design</a> back in April, and hopefully just like then I'll be full of inspiration and ideas by the end of the week.

The Future of Web Apps is an event looking at today's popular online apps and what's next on the web. Topics covered include app interface design, online communities, entrepreneurship, mobile apps and there will be a live <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> pitch and live <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation/">Diggnation</a>.

<h4>Speakers</h4>
There's a great lineup for the event, some big heavyweights in the industry.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Kevin Rose</strong> <em><a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a></em></li>
	<li><strong>Blaine Cook</strong> <em><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a></em></li>
	<li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> <em><a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></em></li>
	<li><strong>Bret Taylor</strong> <em><a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a></em></li>
</ul>
Of course there's a <a href="http://london2008.futureofwebapps.com/speakers">lot of other speakers</a> I can't wait to hear from, but these are the few that stood out.
<h4>See you there?</h4>
Anyone else for the FOWA? Let me know so we can chat over a (free) beer :)
