  content: Ah, yes I remember this form when I first setup MAMP/CocoaMySQL. Actually,
    I tend to use MySQL Tools' Administrator and/or Query browser for my MySQL needs
    and don't use CocoaMySQL but perhaps I should give it another whirl.

  content: Thanks for the tip, CocoaMySQL (now Sequel Pro) works great, one question
    though, is it possible to connect to a MySQL database thatÂ´s not on my computer?

  content: "This post is a little lifesaver to those of us dabblers in the realm of
    MySQL (who don't understand the gory details, nor want to).  In Sequel Pro (CocoaMySQL's
    replacement), this hint can be used to connect to MAMP MySQL, but isn't required.
    \ In Sequel Pro, there are two ways to connect (actually, three, but SSH is over
    my head): Standard and Socket.  In Standard, you can connect using host \"127.0.0.1\"
    and port \"8889\".  In Socket, you can connect using host \"localhost\" and socket
    \"/applications/mamp/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock\".  Some of this info is also alluded
    to on the welcome page that opens when you start up MAMP.    By the way, for any
    Rapidweaver users out there, you can use this hint for viewing MAMP MySQL data
    (via PHP scripts) live in Rapidweaver's preview mode.  The PHP script to make
    the MySQL connection just specifies the host as the path to the socket, instead
    of \"localhost\", for example:\r\n$con = mysql_connect(\":/applications/mamp/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock\",\"root\",\"root\");\r\nNote
    the \":\" at the start of the path."

I came across this problem when I converted to a Mac and I was trying to connect to a MySQL database on MAMP using CocoaMySQL. CocoaMySQL wasn't able to connect to the database. Thought the solution may be useful to others.

<!--more-->

<h4>Settings</h4>
Host:localhost
User:root
Password:root

If you try to connect now you may get the following error:
<strong>Unable to connect to host localhost.
Be sure that the address is correct and that you have the necessary privileges.
MySQL said: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)</strong>

<h4>Solution</h4>
So here's the extra bit. Enter the following in the <strong>socket</strong> field:
<strong>/applications/mamp/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock</strong>
