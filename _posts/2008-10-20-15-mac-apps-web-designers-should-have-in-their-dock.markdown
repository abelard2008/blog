    to transmit is fetch, another great ftp program."

  content: "I personally prefer NeoOffice ( http://www.neooffice.org/ ) . I don't
    do anything all that fancy with my Office documents like text editing and simple
    spreadsheets that I need to pay so much for an Office suite and NeoOffice is compatible
    with Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents that it's not a problem. And it costs
    nothing which might be a big thing for a newbie freelancer.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty
    of free alternatives to everything but I'd definitely put my money on the Adobe
    Creative Suite instead of Office.\r\n\r\nAlso, Textmate is a great editor but
    if you want to save a few bucks I'd definitely recommend using something like
    Smultron ( http://tuppis.com/smultron/ ) which is absolutely free and a great
    code editor, works great with Transmit.\r\n\r\nIf you're a freelancer web designer
    then you definitely want to use an app that keeps track of the time you spend
    on projects. I highly recommend something like On The Job from Stunt Software
    ( http://stuntsoftware.com/OnTheJob/ ) which is a fantastic way to track time
    you spend on each project. I use it on all my projects and it's a great way to
    see how much you actually spend time on projects."

    $99 on Coda, there's no need in forking out the extra $129 for the other apps
    (or vice versa)."

    but I feel they all contribute to a good designer. e.g. Microsoft Office (or Office
    alternatives) isn't to do with design but is useful for writing specs, invoices,
    dealing with client assets, making presentations at talks or to clients etc.\r\n\r\nTwitter
    is a useful tool for following web designers who write good articles, make good
    apps or recommend good articles. And you can set it to refresh every hour (or
    turn it off) so it's not a constant distraction."

    by searching \"macs for web designers\" \r\n\r\nbut still I switch to windows
    via bootcamp to get my web projects done. maybe because still I haven't get used
    to it but something tells me that windows works well. it would be great if you
    can help me out.\r\n\r\nFirst, I think Tasks such as Copy, Cutting, Pasting, Taking
    Screenshots are easier in windows. also the Star Menu bar gives you a very quick
    overview of everything which makes switching between apps and folders so much
    easier when you are designing. working with softwares also I think better in windows
    which everything is in full screen mode and plain allows you to focus on your
    project. Also I have some problem with photoshop in mac (instant switching between
    layers mode \"normal, darken, screen\" with arrow keys which u can't do in in
    mac)\r\n\r\nI don't want to get back to windows as I really enjoy being in Os
    X environment. I do all of web surfing and fun stuff with OS X but still as a
    Professional designer and as I'm responsible to my clients, still I can't only
    depend on Mac. I get things done much faster and easier with windows. \r\ndid
    you guys face these problems? what should I do with your experience. Please don't
    come up with routine answers such as you will get use to it or ... pro people
    know What I mean. and ofcourse, lack of having IE is a huge deal for me. I keep
    checking my website on major browsers after writing a line of code, which the
    IE TAB extension for fire fox in windows do the great job. I think the thing is
    that when you are in windows, you don't need mac, but with mac, you may need windows
    sometimes. but as I said, I want to stick with my macbook pro and OS X, any suggestion
    \ appreciated and thanks for your time reading my long comment. ( I'm frustrated
    :D )"

    a matter of getting used to it. Most of the shortcuts you know using the 'Ctrl'

    paste is Cmd+V, so it's a matter of your mind getting used to these new shortcuts.
    The full screen thing annoyed me at first but I got used to it and now I really
    like it because I can work with multiple apps a lot easier than before.\r\n\r\nI
    think it's worth just diving in with the mac, forgetting about the PC and seeing
    how that goes after 1 week. When I converted I waited until a week when I wasn't
    super busy so that I had time to get used to it. But I can honestly say now that
    I am far more efficient on the mac and get a lot more done."

    Have you heard of and used exposé yet? Basically it lets you see all your windows
    in every program or all your windows in your current program. Go to: Apple Icon
    &gt; System Preferences &gt; \"Exposé and Spaces\" (on leopard at least). Then
    see which F## key is responsible. You'll probably find it a useful tool! (Also
    if you have a mouse, the side button usually does exposé).\r\n\r\n4) A couple
    people have said this above (including me), but Quicksilver is a life saver. It
    brings up box where you can search for any program, file, etc. Kind of like Finder,
    but a whole lot cooler. Look into it.\r\n\r\n5) Regarding screenshots. Sure the
    print screen button is easier for windows. But did you know about all the options
    you have built into OS X for screenshots?\r\n- apple key + shift + 3 = normal
    screenshot\r\n- apple key + shift + 4 = drag on the screen where you want the
    picture taken\r\n- apple key + shift + 4. then space = take a screenshot of a
    specific window, but not the whole screen."

    Cmd+Shift+4 and then hit the spacebar your cursor will turn into a camera which
    will do the same thing as Paparrazi. It'll copy the image of the window you have
    up, and even include the drop shadow which looks great on blog posts. Just a tip!\r\n\r\nGreat

  content: "@Dylan: Yes, welcome to the mac community. It's unbelievable how much
    difference that small leap of faith to the mac can make in your life. As Soheil
    said, after 1 month you'll be flying.\r\n\r\nIf I was going for one I would go
    for Coda. Although that depends if you have Adobe CS that may have Dreamweaver
    included.\r\n\r\n@Soheil: I don't think there's code/preview available in Coda,
    I think you have to choose one or the other. Best place to start is their site.
    Some useful video tutorials http://www.panic.com/coda/developer A lot of things
    I didn't realise you could do before watching these"

  content: "@Lee &amp; @Dylan: I have Adobe Cs4 Master Collection but i still prefer
    to do all front-end coding in Coda. Like i said in my previous post, the only
    time i use dreamweaver is when i'm using the plugin for the Envotu CMS. (i can
    code for envotu in coda as well but the plugin that makes it a tad bit quicker
    is only for dreamweaver).\r\n\r\nBesides that though, all Coda all the time. I
    much prefer it over the other editors available. \r\n\r\n\r\nI agree with Lee
    and Sohell 100% in regards to 1 month and you'll be flying. I remember when i
    got my first mac and i actually could not figure out how to turn it off for about
    15 minutes. Sad i know, but it's the small things that we get used to haha. \r\n\r\nNow
    honest to god, i dread every time i have to touch a pc, the mac is just such a
    better platform to work on."

    anyway, they're both good OSes, it just depends on what you wanna do with them.

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/15-mac-apps-web-designers-should-have-in-their-dock"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-347" title="dock1" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/dock2.jpg" alt="Dock" /></a></div>
Back in June when I was converting from a PC to a MacBook Pro (best decision I ever made) I asked around to see what apps people recommended for the Mac. There are a <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/">lot of nice apps</a> available for Mac OSX that aren't available for Windows.

I've compiled a list of Mac Apps I have in my OSX dock that I use on a daily basis and should be useful to other Mac users and/or web designers.

<!--more-->
<h4>1. <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe Creative Suite</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.adobe.com"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ps.png" alt="Photoshop" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
An obvious and primary requirement (I feel) all serious web designers should have. I couldn't get through the day without Photoshop while Illustrator and Flash are constantly called upon. I hear Fireworks is good too, especially for compressing images, but I've yet to use it myself.
<h4>2. <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/transmit.png" alt="Transmit" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
Transmit is an FTP client for Mac. Edit remote files, synchronize, search, SSL, tabs; it covers all your daily FTP needs.
<h4>3. <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/code.png" alt="Coda" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
Coda is a light-weight all in one text editor. You can edit your code, preview your web page, upload to server (integration with Transmit), edit CSS and run commands in Terminal; all from within this one app. I would use Coda for front-end development.
<h4>4. <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://macromates.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/textmate.png" alt="TextMate" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
Textmate is another text editor that I prefer using for back-end development. Code completion, snippets, syntax colouring are some of the things I enjoy about Textmate along with ease of customizing fonts and colours.
<h4>5. <a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/">CocoaMySQL</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/cocoa.png" alt="Cocoa" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
CocoaMySQL gives you an interface to work with your MySQL databases. This is a desktop alternative to PHPMyAdmin, which is a lot quicker and in my opinion a lot easier to operate.

<strong>UPDATE 13/12/08: CocoaMySQL has been abandoned and replaced with <a href="http://www.mjmedia.com.au/sequel-pro.html">Sequel Pro</a>. Works just as well and looks even better. <a href="http://www.mjmedia.com.au/sequel-pro.html">Check it out</a>.</strong>
<h4>6. <a href="http://www.mamp.info/">MAMP</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.mamp.info/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/mamp.png"  alt="Mamp" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
MAMP is an easy way to get Apache, MySQL and PHP up and running on your machine. Just by running MAMP all these three services will be up and running, no messing around in Terminal needed.
<h4>7. <a href="http://www.culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.culturedcode.com/things/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/things.png" alt="Things" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
Great app for getting things done. Set yourself project tasks and daily tasks and check them off as and when you get them done.
<h4>8.<a href="http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/"> CSS Edit</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/css.png" alt="CSS Edit" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
A very good CSS editor. It allows for real time previews of your website and styles and is a very efficient app allowing you to easily find all styles being applied to certain elements.
<h4>9. <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/trans.png"  alt="Transmission" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
Transmission is used for downloading/uploading torrents over the net. Useful for sharing files with friends and colleagues (among other things)
<h4>10. <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/mars.png" alt="MarsEdit" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
MarsEdit allows you to compile draft blog posts on your local machine before publishing them live on your blog. I use it daily to take notes on various blog topics I think of and then I can easily compile a blog post over the course of a week.
<h4>11. <a href="http://skitch.com/">Skitch</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://skitch.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/skitch.png" alt="Skitch" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
I was only recently introduced to this by <a href="http://goodonpaper.org">GoodOnPaper</a> @ FOWA. Allows you to easily share images/screenshots on the web and using the Skitch editor you can add notes to your image or highlight areas of a screenshot. Very useful and saves having to load up Photoshop for simple tasks.
<h4>12. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0014BBQ5M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=10homepa-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B0014BBQ5M">Parallels Desktop</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0014BBQ5M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=10homepa-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B0014BBQ5M"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/parallels.png" alt="Parallels" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
You can run Windows XP or Vista on your Mac using Parallels. Handy for being able to test your websites in versions of IE (<a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE">using Multiple IEs</a>) and if there are any Windows only apps you need to use, e.g. Microsoft Access.
<h4>13. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000WR2F2M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=10homepa-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B000WR2F2M">Office</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000WR2F2M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=10homepa-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B000WR2F2M"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/office.png" alt="Office" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
A good old favorite for creating text documents, preparing slideshows or looking after sets of data. There are a few Mac alternatives, and of course online alternatives, but I personally prefer Office.
<h4>14. <a href="http://www.derailer.org/paparazzi/">Paparazzi</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.derailer.org/paparazzi/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/pap.png" alt="Paparazzi" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
Paparazzi takes full screenshots of webpages. The problem with Cmd+Shift+3 is that it only takes a screenshot of the visible screen. Paparrazi takes the whole height of the page, even below the fold, so it's great for showing screenshots of your web designs.
<h4>15. <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a></h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/twit.png" alt="Twitterific" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
Easily interact with Twitterland via Twitterific. Saves you having to make the trip to <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> to see what's going on as it can retrieve and send tweets for you.
