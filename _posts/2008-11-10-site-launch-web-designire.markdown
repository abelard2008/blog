<h4>Irish Web Design Gallery</h4>
My latest mini-project is a <a href="http://www.webdesignire.com">web design gallery</a> for websites and designers from Ireland and Northern Ireland - <a href="http://www.webdesignire.com">www.webdesignire.com</a>.

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.webdesignire.com"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/web2.jpg" alt="web.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="200" /></a></div>

<!--more-->

I use galleries all the time and they're great for getting a daily dose of inspiration and as a web designer they're a great way to help promote your website.

<h5>Why another gallery?</h5>
There are 100s of galleries online, <a href="http://cssmania.com">CSS Mania</a>, <a href="http://bestwebgallery.com/">Best Web Gallery</a>, <a href="http://cssdrive.com/">CSS Drive</a> to name a few, but there isn't a niche gallery for Ireland.

The aim for Web Designire is to:
<ol>
<li>Help to promote Irish websites</li>
<li>Showcase the best designs coming out of Ireland and Northern Ireland to the rest of the world</li>
<li>Provide inspiration for other web designers</li>
</ol>

Visit <a href="http://www.webdesignire.com">Web Designire</a> and if you're from Ireland or Northern Ireland remember to suggest any sites you've designed. If not, feel free to vote on the sites showcased.
