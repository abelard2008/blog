  content: "What a Coincidence, I was looking for a way so that I can test my website
    on IE using parallels, after I come up with a solution, you post an article here,
    but seems my way is easier ;)\r\n\r\nWhat I have done is I just went to my network
    connection setting and took my IP address on MAC, So instead of http://localhost
    , I typed my IP address and then Woof, everything is working fine, just you have
    to change your wordpress home address to that IP address as well instead of localhost."

  content: Got through your instructions (the original article is no longer available,
    BTW). Up until step 5. How do I "change my framework"? in OSX? in Win? in Parallels?.
    Where do I go to do step 5?

I use <a href="http://www.mamp.info">MAMP</a> for running Apache, MySQL and PHP on the Mac. A simple click and all 3 are up and running in 5 seconds and you can easily configure your ports and root folder.

However, I was having trouble accessing my MAMP server through Parallels. I use Parallels to <strong>test my sites on Internet Explorer</strong> and it's pretty important that I'm able to do this in development before going live.

I found this <a href="http://timothyfletcher.com/journal/posts/setup-guide-for-mamp-parallels-desktop-and-wordpress">excellent solution from Tim Fletcher</a> and thought I'd summarize it below so you too can get testing your <strong>Wordpess, CodeIgniter, PHP sites</strong> etc. through Parallels.
<!--more-->
<h4>1. Install Bonjour for Windows</h4>
Download and install (in your Windows OS) Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/bonjourforwindows.html">Bonjour For Windows</a>.
<h4>2. Enable file sharing</h4>
Now back in Mac OSX, enable <strong>file sharing</strong>. System Preferences &gt; Sharing &gt; File Sharing.
<div class="blog-img"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/picture-6.png" border="0" alt="File Sharing" width="472" height="184" /></div>
<h4>3. Change your computer name</h4>
From the 'Sharing' window you have open, change your computers name to <strong>localhost.local</strong>.
<div class="blog-img"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/picture-15.png" border="0" alt="Computer Name" width="472" height="184" /></div>
<h4>4. Change your Apache and MySQL ports in MAMP</h4>
Run MAMP and open up 'Preferences'. Change the Apache Port to <strong>80</strong> and the MySQL Port to <strong>3306</strong>
<div class="blog-img"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/picture-16.png" border="0" alt="Ports" width="338" height="229" /></div>
N.B. Make sure there are no other instances of MySQL running.
<h4>5. Configure your framework</h4>
Change the settings on your framework to reflect the new settings.

The example I've used here is Wordpress. Change your Wordpress address (&amp; blog address) to <strong>http://localhost.local</strong> (Settings &gt; General).
<div class="blog-img"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/picture-17.png" border="0" alt="Settings" width="392" height="133" /></div>
<h4>Volia!</h4>
You should now be able to access your site from your Parallels Windows environment using the URL http://localhost.local and you can test your site in IE.
