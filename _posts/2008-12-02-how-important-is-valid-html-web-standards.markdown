  content: Great job Carlos, we web designers and developers have a job to keep educating
    the community about standards compliancy, and making sure we set a good example!
    (and thus my website also validates, of course)

    specified.  I guess that's an easy fix at least.  CSS valid 2.1.\r\nI really need
    to re-do my site for 1024 screens and fix up the content but I'll continue to
    meet the web standards.  I agree with the philosophies of the W3C with regards
    universal compatability and accessibility.  My site is very basic so it's not
    difficult to make it valid.  I guess I don't kow enough to judge say...eBay, but
    maybe that's partly why it renders so slowly?"

  content: "clean xhtml and css/web standards matter, but doesnt necessarily mean
    it has to validate.. \r\n\r\nthe w3c standards tend to nit-pick over the smallest
    discrepancies that has no bearing over the functionality/browser support/rendering
    etc. changing the code just for the sake of validation makes no difference in
    my opinion.\r\n\r\ndesigners in general dont like being told what to do. enforcing
    the ideology that you're not worthy of being a web designer if your code does
    not validate with big screaming red text is pedantic and borderline dictatorial.\r\n\r\nmost
    designers have now made the step to integrate web standards into their workflow.
    This should be enough, we all have too much other stuff to learn, too much to
    do, than to be worrying about the w3c hammering down your door..\r\n\r\nunless
    its a client's request, i dont bother checking to see if my code validates. if
    it works, it validates."

    serve much benefit since IE (even version 8) doesn't support true XHTML. \r\n\r\nPersonally
    I use XHTML Strict for my site, and try to make it validate on every page (except
    for when Wordpress messes up my flash embed code from time to time). \r\n\r\nOut
    of the sites in your list that validate, I think you'd be surprised how many DO
    NOT validate on their sub-pages. \r\n\r\nAs far as whether validation is important
    or not, to be honest users don't care :)"

  content: "@Richard: \"we all have too much other stuff to learn, too much to do\"
    - very true, it might not be worth your time agonizing over validating every page
    on your site. It's usually one of those things I'll do once I finish a website
    but it usually (fingers crossed) only takes 10 minutes or so to do any fixes.\r\n\r\n@Jin:
    \"to be honest users don’t care\" - I agree and I don't see the value in using
    badges (usually in the footer) that show your page is valid"

    are. As Joost mentioned, his CSS errors are deliberate simply because the validator
    doesn't see some of the modern CSS attributes as correct but the browsers are
    able to handle them fine.\r\n\r\nFound a good quote from Matt Cutts, Google engineer,
    on Google not validating. \r\n\r\n\"Google's home page doesn't validate and that's
    mostly by design to save precious bytes. Will the world end because Google doesn't
    put quotes around color attributes? No, and it makes the page load faster. :)\""

    through the website of one of their departments (about 15,000 pages) and validating

    you first start site building.  Its also good because I often deal with smaller
    firms who won't keep updating their basic web design and so will have some future-proofing
    against web browser updates.  The bigger companies you have profiled will regularly
    be optimizing their sites and will always react quickly to browser updates.\r\n\r\nBut
    it's also true that it is not worth spending too much time on for a commercial
    project as long as you know why they don't validate and that there is a good reason
    for it."

    projects. I'm impressed with your site and have \"Permanent Tabbed\" you in Firefox.
    Some great articles that have led me to validate and be conscientious of how I
    am implementing code. I just cannot help notice something which I learned from
    day one (nearly - hehe) is that on any site I build that links to external sites,
    I ALWAYS use \"target=\" in the URL. It's imperative to keep people and your target
    audience on your site. I did use some links on this page which linked in the same
    tab (and led me away from your site completely). I then got embroiled in some
    validation testing and if really distracted, I may forget about bookmarking you
    or going back to your site. But like I said, I have you \"Permanent tabbed\".....hehe.....
    I just thought I would mention this as I have seen it on other sites and is often
    overlooked.\r\n\r\nNice advice and tips here."

    about it. I don't peek and judge at how good a web designer is by validation alone.
    Most of the time you can somehow sense that the designer did their best to produce
    a quality product for their client even if their code doesn't validate.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for this article."

    Compliance and found on average 28% error rate. In fact I have been searching
    for a valid website and I plan to keep a running tally on my website... until
    I find one!
---
As a web designer you're encouraged to write <strong>valid code</strong>, but is it really important?

I've took a look at the reasons behind validation and checked out <strong>25 of the web's most popular websites</strong> to see if they bother validating their code.

<a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/how-important-is-valid-html-web-standards"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/cm-capture-29.png" alt="Validation" title="Validation" /></a>

<!--more-->
<h4>What is validation?</h4>
<blockquote> Validation is a process of checking your documents against a formal Standard, such as those published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)  for HTML and XML-derived Web document types, or by the WapForum for WML, etc. It serves a similar purpose to spell checking...<a href="http://validator.w3.org/docs/why.html">W3C</a></blockquote>

<h4>Why validate, what are the benefits?</h4>

<h5>1. Non uniform browser correction</h5>
Non valid pages rely on the browser to <strong>auto-correct your code</strong>, and each browser does this differently. So if you forget to close a tag, Firefox might ignore this but Safari doesn't and you end up with a <strong>broken layout</strong>.

<h5>2. Rendering time</h5>
If your code is valid the browser has to do less thinking as it doesn't have to correct any code, therefore the <strong>page will render faster</strong>.

<h5>3. Future proofing</h5>
You never know what's around the corner in regards to technology but the chances are that if you have valid (X)HTML, you're ensuring that your <strong>website will work with future technologies</strong>.

<h5>4. Google prefers valid code</h5>
Shaun Anderson conducted an interesting validation test; <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/seo-blog/index.php/official-google-prefers-valid-html-css/">Does Google like valid code?</a>.

This experiment included 4 pages with the same content but a mixture of valid and non-valid HTML and CSS. The result was that <strong>Google picked up the page that had valid HTML</strong> and valid CSS and indexed this page over the rest.

<h5>5. Accessibility</h5>
A valid site is more likely to be <strong>accessible to all types of browsers</strong>, platforms and screen readers.

<h5>6. Self satisfaction</h5>
If <strong>feels good</strong> when you <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">run a validation check</a> on your site and you see the green bar appear :)

<h4>What are the common validation errors and how to fix them?</h4>

<h5>a. Ampersands</h5>
This always catches me out. Ampersands must be written '<strong>&amp;amp;</strong>' and not just '&amp;'. This is true for writing urls too.
<pre><code><a href="http://images.google.com/imghp?hl=en&amp;tab=wi"></code></pre>

<h5>b. Quotations</h5>
Element property values must be put within quotes.
<pre><code><body bgcolor="#ffffff"></code></pre>

<h5>c. Closing tags</h5>
All elements must be closed off, even image tags if you're using a XHTML DTD.
<pre><code><img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" /></code></pre>

<h5>d. Doctypes</h5>
Your page must have a valid Document Type Definition (DTD) at the top of the page, and take note that it is case sensitive.
<pre><code><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"></code></pre>

<h5>e. Nesting elements incorrectly</h5>
Elements must be opened and closed in order.
<pre><code><p><strong><em>Paragraph</em></strong></p></code></pre>

<h4>Do the web's biggest sites validate?</h4>
So do all the big and popular websites out there validate? Below I've put together a selection of some of the most popular websites and ordered them from best(valid) to worst.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
I think it's worthwhile validating your websites and it's good practice. From looking at the sites above however (which are all great sites and designs), it's obvious that not having a validated website is not the end of the world.

If you're like me though <strong>you'll sleep better at night knowing your website validates</strong>.

<h4>Does your site validate?</h4>
It was very hard work trying to track down valid websites for this post so it would be great to see some examples. Use the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator to check your site</a> then submit your link and comments below.

It would also be good to hear your points about validation and if you think it's worthwhile.
