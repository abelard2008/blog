  content: I tried surfing in Hawai'i and San Diego. LA really isn't the place to
    go so don't feel too bad! Love the list, although the bungee jump would scare
    the life outta me!

  content: "Hi Lee, Thought you might like a challenge. Every year Dublin have a marathon
    (usually on fathers day). I did it many years ago (with help from good friends
    pushing my wheelchair). Then, over 48000 women took part in it.\r\nThere is a
    catch, if you do it, and its only 10KL, you need to enter as a female and dress
    as a female in order to complete.  Its good fun and many people use it to raise
    money for charity. Many men chose Nun, Spice Girls, Cher - you name it they dressed
    as it. Do you think you can rise to the challenge?"

I had a nice few relaxing days away from the computer over Christmas. It was hard but I managed it. I ate loads of turkey and now I'm in the middle of all these sweets and chocolate that I <em>'need'</em> to eat. Now comes the new year and the plan of action for 2009.
<!--more-->
<h4>2008 list</h4>
I made a list last year of 5 things that I wanted to accomplish in 2008:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Launch a web application</strong> - Success: <a href="http://www.thebigwordproject.com">The Big Word Project</a></li>
	<li><strong>Run a marathon</strong> - Success: Belfast marathon (4h 43m)</li>
	<li><strong>Skydive</strong> - Success: Las Vegas during summer</li>
	<li><strong>Play a round of golf with Dad</strong> - Success: Fathers' Day</li>
	<li><strong>Live away from NI for at least 1 month</strong> - Fail: Didn't happen</li>
</ul>
So I accomplished 4 out of the 5 objectives. The living away from NI thing didn't work out, mainly due to lack of time and money (both consequences of doing a Masters), although I did make it over to the States for a great 2 week holiday.
<h4>2009 list</h4>
I found it useful last year writing down what I wanted to accomplish in 2008 so this year I'm going to make my list public and maybe this will make me even more determined to accomplish everything.

This year I have 10 main objectives:
<h5>1. Run another marathon</h5>
My aim is to run a marathon faster than I did in 2008 (i.e. faster than 4h 43m). I was disappointed with last years result, my calves gave up after 18 miles so I need to train harder.
<ul><li>I've registered to run the London Marathon in April</li></ul>
<h5>2. Read more</h5>
I haven't been reading as much lately mainly because I'm on the laptop too much. I need to make some time for this as there's a lot of books I want to read.
<ul><li><del datetime="2009-02-25T00:30:27+00:00">The Articulate Executive</del></li><li><del datetime="2009-02-25T00:30:27+00:00">Tick My Boxes</del></li><li><del datetime="2009-02-25T00:30:27+00:00">The Unlimited Freelancer</del></li></ul>
<h5>3. Bungee jump</h5>
I did a skydive last year so why not do a bungee this year. If I face my fears I'll have nothing to fear.
<h5>4. Learn to play the guitar</h5>
I bought an electric guitar 2 years ago and I never <em>really</em> learnt how to play it. Time to learn.
<h5>5. Go surfing</h5>
Something I've always wanted to do, and am kicking myself I didn't do it during the summer when over in L.A. If I don't make it somewhere cool to surf this year I'll have to settle for <a href="http://www.portrush.org.uk">Portrush</a>.
<h5>6. Spend less time on the computer</h5>
Yes, spend <strong>less</strong> time on the computer. These days I wake up, open the laptop and apart from the odd break to travel to Uni or go to the gym I'm on it until the early hours of the morning. If I organise my time on the laptop a bit better I can make more time for other things, like the real world.
<h5>7. Blog more</h5>
I like writing interesting web design articles and I've been pretty consistent with my blogging as of late. In 2009 I'd like to write a couple of guest posts for other popular design blogs and also see if I can manage to get a post I write featured on the Digg homepage; that would be sweet.

<li><a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/03/8-tips-to-design-a-charity-website/">Guest post on Web Designer Depot</a></li>
</ul>
<h5>8. Speak at an event</h5>
I enjoy sharing my knowledge and I believe being able to present and communicate well is important, so I'd like some more practice and experience at presenting
<h5>9. Launch a successful web application</h5>
An application that has its fair share of users, makes money and is fun to run.
<ul><li>Launched Lookaly in February. Success yet to be determined :)</li></ul>
<h5>10. Do something for charity</h5>
Help benefit a charity whether that be raising money or helping out in some way.
<ul><li>Raising money for Action for Kids as sponsorship for London Marathon.</li></ul>
<h5>Bonus: Be an extra in a movie, TV program or advert</h5>
Just something I've always wanted to do.
<h5>Bonus: Climb Kilimanjaro</h5>
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leemunroe/2973286370/">I climbed Ben Nevis</a> (highest mountain in UK) in 2008 so this is the next milestone. Whether 2009 is the year it will happen I don't know yet.
