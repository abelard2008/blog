  content: I've been using sxxipper for a while now, its my favourite plugin. It does
    something similar except its for any forms. It's a lifesaver if several people
    (i.e. me and the missus) use the same machine for various accounts, gmail, twitter
    etc. I'll give this one a go too.

You like to comment on blog posts but you're <strong>sick of having to enter the usual name, mail and website fields</strong> (even with autofill it still requires effort).

If you're using Firefox there's a handy solution. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9095">EasyComment</a> is a <strong>plugin that stores this default information for you</strong>. Then, when you're on a blog post and you want to leave a comment, click the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9095">easyComment</a> button and <strong>it will fill in all the fields</strong>. You can even enter a default message like 'Nice post, thanks' if that's all you want to say.

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9095">Click here to get easyComment.</a>

The easyComment button is located at the bottom of your browser window.
<div class="blog-img"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/easy.jpg" border="0" alt="easy.jpg" width="310" height="145" /></div>
Without easyComment, it takes approximately 10 seconds to fill in your name, email and url. Assuming you leave 1 comment per day, that's <strong>70 seconds per week</strong> or <strong>310 seconds per month</strong> or 3,650 seconds per year you'll save. That's an<strong> extra hour</strong> you could be playing Halo or World of Warcraft ;)
