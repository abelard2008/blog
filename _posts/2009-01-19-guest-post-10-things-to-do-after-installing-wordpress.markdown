I started the year looking to <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/new-years-resolutions-for-2009/">write a few guest posts</a> for other blogs and not just my own so I approached <a href="http://twitter.com/problogdesign">Michael</a> from <a href="http://www.problogdesign.com/">Pro Blog Design</a> with an idea for a post.

The post takes a look at <a href="http://www.problogdesign.com/wordpress/10-things-to-do-after-installing-wordpress/">what you should do after installing Wordpress</a> and acts as a <strong>checklist</strong> that you can use to ensure you've changed and activated all that you should do for each of your <strong>Wordpress sites</strong>. I came up with the checklist initially for myself but thought it would be useful to share, especially for beginners.

Pro Blog Design focuses on blog and Wordpress posts, and has a good established following so it was the perfect choice of site for this post.
