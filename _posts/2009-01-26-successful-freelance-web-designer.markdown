  content: Hey Soheil, lol yes indeed, no secret it's affiliated :) but honestly I
    wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was worth it. Mason and James have
    put together a great book. Report back once you give it a read

I just finished reading <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=31382&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=46370">The Unlimited Freelancer</a>; an eBook by the guys at <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/">Freelance Folder</a>, that I was lucky enough to receive for a review. It's a guide that delves into <strong>becoming the ultimate freelancer</strong>, covering an introduction to freelancing, putting automated systems into place, building your team and ultimately making a lot more money :D

<!--more-->
<blockquote class="pullquote">Freelancing is about the freedom to chase and achieve the life you want</blockquote>
I greatly enjoyed this book and I could identify with a lot about what it said. I'm not usually a big fan of eBooks (there's a lot of rubbish out there) but this was enjoyable and useful.
<h4>The problem with freelancing</h4>
As a freelancer it's easy to fall into one (or all) of these traps:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Over worked</strong> and underpaid</li>
	<li>Scrambling to meet <strong>deadlines</strong></li>
	<li>Needing more <strong>clients</strong></li>
	<li>Wishing for free <strong>time</strong></li>
	<li>Frustrated with <strong>admin</strong> overheads</li>
</ul>
Some of the things that you, as a freelancer, should be implementing to get rid of the problems above:
<ul>
	<li>Use <strong>systems</strong> to reduce your workload</li>
	<li><strong>Outsource</strong> boring tasks</li>
	<li>Create assets that generate <strong>recurring revenue</strong> - work once and generate money for a long time</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sneak preview</h4>
I don't want to share all the great tips that the book has to offer freelancers, but here's a quick example of how to save yourself more time.
<h5>Automated systems can save you 5 hours per week (or 260 hours per year)</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Think of everything you do that takes up time</li>
	<li>Now write down checklist of what you have to do, e.g. website proposals</li>
	<li>Now create a template proposal that you can use over and over again, and isn't specific to one client</li>
	<li>Bingo, you just saved a couple of hours per week</li>
</ul>
This is a pretty obvious example, but if you<a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=31382&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=46370"> check out the book</a> you'll be provided with a lot more tips and a lot more inspiration.

The book is <strong>$29</strong>, a fair price for this 200 page document. I'd recommend <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=31382&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=46370">The Unlimited Freelancer</a> not just to freelancers, but businesses owners, entrepreneurs and students also. It reads well, it's extremely <strong>helpful</strong> and it <strong>inspires</strong>. Oh, and they do <strong>guarantee you a complete refund</strong> if you don't like it.

Let me know what you think of it if you end up reading it, it's gave me lots to think about.
