  content: "Being one of the second wave of MA students, I agree with Lee here a lot.
    In fact he has the nail on the head on this.  Even ask yourself, \"Who am I?\"
    there is quite a bit of soul searching to do on the MA.\r\n\r\nI think one important
    point made by Lee is:\r\n\r\n\"Multidisciplinary Design seems like the natural
    transition from IMD (same University, similar lecturers) but there are other courses
    out there and it makes sense to see what there is, both in Northern Ireland and
    across the water.\"\r\n\r\nI don't regret doing the MA, but would like to have
    had more time to see what other courses are out there. \r\n\r\nAnd my last two
    cents, Multidisciplinary Design is not Interactive Multimedia and Design. So it
    won't always be Visual Basic (yes!) But it involves more why you do the things
    you do, and why you make the decisions you do."

  content: "Doesnt matter how good or bad a university course is, its the work thats
    in your portfolio that gets you employed. \r\n\r\ni know people who got a first
    in their degrees and masters etc but could never get a job in design since their
    portfolio demonstrated they werent good enough.\r\n\r\nyou can prove to someone
    how much you know about web design as much as you like with a degree/masters on
    a cv but unless they can see with their own eyes the work you can do to back it
    up, employment can be alot harder to achieve.\r\n\r\ntheres alot of designers
    out there, some of the best in the world, who are self taught and never went to
    university. \r\n\r\nthe point in this - BACK UP your degree/masters with a good
    portfolio, and youl make yourself an extremely good prospect for any company."

    You're spot on. If I was hiring designer their portfolio would make a far greater
    impact than their CV. You definitely do not need a degree to be a great designer,
    but it can contribute to becoming a great designer."

  content: "@Barry: I know that was directed at Liam but yeah, it's quite a struggle
    getting through the year not having a wage and paying fees. \r\n\r\nWhat I did
    was monetized my major project http://kit.meout.net and was able to sell a couple
    of licenses for it before and during masters. I also did some freelance work,
    but it's hard to fit that in. And Paddy and I launched <a href=\"http://thebigwordproject.com\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">TBWP</a>, which provided some additional funds :)\r\n\r\nAdvice:
    If you can, make money from your major project,  think of a project that can make
    you some money and work it into your masters 1st/2nd semester (some sort of useful
    website/blog/service?). And you could start freelancing now then build up a decent
    client base over the summer."

  content: "Lee having read your blog, you are obviously doing well and have gained
    alot of experience since IMD in web development. Well Done.\r\n\r\nHaving gained
    a 2:1 in IMD graduating in 2008, I am yet to gain a full time job in the industry.
    From my experience alot of my class mates have yet to find a suitable job and
    I feel one of the problems with IMD was that it is too generalised i.e you sample
    a range of topics/skills but never really progess to a good standard. \r\n\r\nThen
    when you do progress to say an interview stage you have some experience in a range
    of things but never really enough of what employers are looking for. So I am now
    in the position of \"do I try to continue\" with the possiblilty of wasting time
    or call it quits &amp; try something new.(maybe the current economic climate is
    a big factor?) \r\n\r\nsorry for the long post,\r\n\r\nPaul"

    uni. we had covered topics but not in-depth. we also assumed that just because
    we had a degree, a job would just fall in our laps.\r\n\r\na degree isnt a full-time
    employment guarantee, its a spring step. to cover every single thing youd need
    to know to be a designer full time would mean a lot longer than 3 years in uni.\r\n\r\ntrust
    me the real work starts when you finish university, and in the competitive world
    of design that means building a portolio.\r\n\r\nfrom my experience of interviews
    with employers (and i had HUNDREDS before scoring my current job), they asked
    to see my portfolio before asking me any questions.\r\n\r\nits easy to get disheartened
    getting knocked back all the time but stick to building your portfolio with freelance
    work and the work will pay off."

  content: "@Paul: \r\n\"I feel one of the problems with IMD was that it is too generalised\"\r\n\r\nI
    think you're right here. I hear a lot of people in the local industry talk about
    the lack of good web designers that come out of IMD but what a lot of people don't
    realise is it's not a web design course. It's design, video, audio, programming,
    web authoring, 3D, games dev, media research etc. Although it just so happens
    that most students end up doing a website for their major project.\r\n\r\nI think
    the course could be split in two, once being more specific to web design and development
    while the other could be more specific to video production, 3D modeling, games
    development etc. This would also cut down the size of the class too.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    back to your question. \r\n\r\n“do I try to continue”\r\n\r\nYes, but only if
    you love what you do and that's the career path you want to take. If you're finding
    it hard to get a job, what are you doing about it so you set yourself up with
    better prospects? Keep learning, read blogs and <a href=\"http://astore.amazon.co.uk/leemunroe-21\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">books</a> daily to get inspiration and tips, build a portfolio
    with some <a href=\"http://www.elance.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">freelance work</a>,
    blog about what interests you.\r\n\r\nAnother thing you can do is become an expert
    in one area of web design/dev. Being a master of all trades isn't always that
    useful to a studio. Become an expert at one of Flash, Flex, Javascript, Ruby on
    Rails, UI design, SEO, accessibility etc. and then there may be a more suitable
    role that you can slot into in a studio."

I recently finished <strong>MA Multidisciplinary Design</strong> at the University of Ulster that I started back in September 2007. Often I get asked by various students and others what the course is like and if it is worth doing. So I thought I would write a quick summary and review of the course to help out any budding under grads or people thinking about taking the course.

<!--more-->
<h4>Setup</h4>
Here is a brief explanation of the course taken from the <a href="http://www.uupadb.com/multidisciplinary_design/">Multidisciplinary Design website</a>.
<blockquote>The programme seeks to establish an environment where creative, self-motivated practitioners from a diverse array of design backgrounds, with different methodologies, can experience a cross-fertilisation of ideas and approaches to the design process.</blockquote>
So basically share ideas and collaborate with people from other design fields, while moving forward in your own field.

The course is <strong>45 weeks</strong> (3 semesters) long. September - June for first two semesters then September - January for the third semester.

The total cost of the course is somewhere around <strong>£3,200</strong> (I can't remember exactly).

The first 2 semesters contain 3 modules each while the third semester only has 1 module, which is your 'Masters Project'. You can <a href="http://www.uupadb.com/postgrad/masters_structure_diagram.pdf">download the masters structure</a> for more details.
<h4>Good</h4>
It has helped develop my <strong>character</strong> and <strong>expertise</strong> tremendously. Confidence, communication, presentation, collaboration, writing and entrepreneurial skills are a number of things the course has influenced and improved in me.

I feel the masters has also put me in a better position career wise. Out of the 100 or so that graduated from my under grad course, Interactive Multimedia Design, I am now one of few who have a masters so this may make a difference if I decided to go for employment.

The course also has a strong <strong>entrepreneurial</strong> aspect to it and encourages students to push their work and ideas forward as businesses. I have left with a good standing as a freelance web designer and I also have a new business venture with <a href="http://lookaly.com">Lookaly</a> that I will be starting to promote in the coming weeks.

It is up to you what you want to do and what research you want to pursue. I started the course wanting to research <strong>usability and web applications</strong>, which I think I adequately fulfilled. Working with people from other design fields was also interesting. You don't realise how much <strong>jargon</strong> you use on a daily basis until you have to interact with non-geeks daily. A different perspective on your work is always good and opens doors to new ideas and inspiration.

The <strong>lecturers</strong> involved are extremely helpful and are always available to chat. We were able to watch as Chris Murphy and Nicklas Persson developed and authored their book '<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/HTML-CSS-Standards-Solutions-Standardistas/dp/1430216069%3FSubscriptionId%3D1YNZ339ZCHHAKYFSY702%26tag%3Dleemunroe-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1430216069">HTML and CSS Web Standards Solutions</a>', which was published at the end of 2008 by Friends of Ed. This shows the high standard of mentoring available. A number of workshops were also arranged for us, which included the guys from <a href="http://designbyfront.com/">Front</a> sharing their project management and process expertise in a 2 day course.

And it was great fun. I had great craic with the rest of my peers, we got to go camping, we got to work on <a href="http://www.thebigwordproject.com/">interesting side projects</a>, we visited <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leemunroe/2927355920/in/set-72157607886936187/">different events</a> and we had good <a href="http://blog.iampaddy.com/wheelchair-per-minute-challenge/">fun in the studio</a>.
<h4>Bad</h4>
There isn't much I can criticize about the course, but I'll flag up a couple of things that annoyed me from time to time.

There are a lot of '<strong>sessions</strong>' in the Art College (where the course is situated). Stuff that should take 2 hours takes a day. Sometimes it's down to not being organised, sometimes it's because you're expected to do more yourself and sometimes it just has to be done. But it always happens.

One thing that we constantly heard was that there was <strong>no budget</strong> (i.e. no money available). The course did run workshops and supply funding for a few things but if you want to go to any events or fund any projects you'll have to sort out <strong>funding yourself</strong>. And it seems to be generally expected that you'll spend a good bit of money on print work (or other) for the end of year shows.

And I felt there was one <strong>module</strong> that could be improved. There were a few classes that I didn't get anything out of and there was a general consensus that they could be improved. Although I think this module has been reviewed and altered since I took it and on the flip side the other modules were extremely useful and interesting.

One last thing to be aware of is that post grad life is nothing like under grad life. You have a lot more work to do and a lot more responsibilities. Apart from maybe the first couple of weeks, the <strong>mid week partying becomes few and far between</strong> :cry:
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
All in all <strong>I would recommend Multidisciplinary Design</strong> at the University of Ulster to anyone looking to further their education and career in the creative industry.

<strong>A few tips and things to ask yourself.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>What do you want to get out of a masters? Ask yourself <strong>why</strong> you want to do a masters.</li>
	<li><strong>Research other courses</strong>. Multidisciplinary Design seems like the natural transition from IMD (same University, similar lecturers) but there are other courses out there and it makes sense to see what there is, both in Northern Ireland and across the water.</li>
	<li>Where do you see yourself in <strong>2 years</strong> after you do a masters. Do you need to do Multidisciplinary Design to get there?</li>
	<li>Think about what it is you want to <strong>research</strong> and <strong>accomplish</strong>. Is Multidisciplinary Design the course to accomplish this? Does the University have all the assets you need?</li>
</ul>
Thanks to all the lecturers and students who made the course interesting and enjoyable, notably Debbie Fraser, <a href="http://www.mcmxc.org/">Chris Murphy</a> and <a href="http://takete.com/">Nicklas Persson</a>. And good luck to <a href="http://blog.iampaddy.com/">Paddy</a>, <a href="http://www.disabilityheroes.com/">Kyle</a>, <a href="http://www.jennaroddy.com/">Jenna</a>, Katherine, Jane and all my classmates for the future. It was a pleasure being involved in the course.
