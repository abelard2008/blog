  content: "Lee, I really think that we have something in common. every time that
    I tend to do something, a related article from you just appear. I wanted to design
    my portfolio website &amp; I thought it would be good if I first do some research
    about it. I read the article about portfolio design in Smashing Magazine and now
    I can see that article is yours. lol\r\n\r\nSame thing happen with Mamp, Remember
    ?!\r\n\r\nAwesome Article, I really appreciate it. helped a lot. thanks."
