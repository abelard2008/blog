Action for Kids is a charity dedicated towards <strong>helping disabled children and their families</strong>. They help transform young lives by supplying kids with <strong>wheelchairs, mobility equipment</strong> and work opportunities.

<h4>Children Action for Kids has helped</h4>
Wheelchairs and mobility equipment cost a lot of money but having it makes a big difference to the kids' lives. Action for Kids were able to help Maleah and William (above).

<strong>Maleah has had 9 broken bones due to a genetic disorder and needed a wheelchair</strong>. Her mum says Action For Kids “saved Maleah’s sanity - without the wheelchair she would be dragging herself round on the floor, frustrated at being restricted”

<strong>William has Spastic Quadroplegic Cerebral Palsy and needed a suitable wheelchair for his dwarfed body</strong>. His new wheelchair now allows him to play with friends.

<h4>Children that need your help</h4>
<strong>Daniel</strong> (above) has <strong>cerebral palsy</strong> and is waiting for a <strong>walker, but it costs £1,470</strong>. Without this he can't get around. <strong>Mark has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</strong>, a muscle wasting and life limiting disease, and needs a <strong>powered wheelchair costing £14,082</strong>.

<h4>I'm running the London marathon for Action for Kids</h4>
I'm sure you can tell by now that this post has a motive ;) As you can see, this charity needs our help to get these children what they need to make their lives better. To help make a difference, I'm running the Flora London Marathon on Sunday 26th April 2009. I'm hoping to <strong>raise £2,000</strong> in sponsorship that I can pass onto Action for Kids.

<h4>How you can help</h4>

<h5> 1. <a href="http://sponsorlee.org">Sponsor me</a></h5>
Join my other friends over at <a href="http://sponsorlee.org">SponsorLee.org</a> and sponsor me if you can spare a few quid for these children.

I've setup this sponsorship site as a way of <strong>saying thank you</strong> and <strong>I'll even link your name back to your website</strong> from the homepage so you get something back in return :)

To entice you further I'm ordering the names by generosity so the more you sponsor the higher up the list your name/link will appear. But whether you contribute £2 or £50, I am very thankful for your support and contribution.

A big thanks to everyone who sponsors me. I really appreciate it.

<h5>2. Promote the site</h5>
