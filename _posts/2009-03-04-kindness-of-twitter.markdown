There's no doubting the power of <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and the ability to share information virally. Just look at the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/twitter/4269765/New-York-plane-crash-Twitter-breaks-the-news-again.html">Hudson plane crash</a> as an example. But what's amazing is the kindness that comes with the Twitter community.

<div style="float:left; margin:0 20px 10px 0;"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=sponsorlee"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/tweetdeck.jpg" border="0" alt="TweetDeck" width="323" height="751" /></a></div>

On Tuesday I launched <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/help-action-for-kids/">Sponsor Lee</a> (to raise sponsorship money for running the London Marathon). I asked a few friends to check it out, I tweeted and blogged about it and all day people were tweeting and retweeting and by the <strong>end of the day £389 had been raised</strong>, the majority of which came from Twitter friends and followers. A lot of these people I haven't even met before.

If I take <a href="http://twitter.com/ismets">@ismets</a> as an example, a designer all the way from Belgium who I've never met, was happy to give some money for a good cause. And <a href="http://twitter.com/vanilla_man">@vanilla_man</a>, whose Twitter profile I can't even understand, was happy to help and featured Sponsor Lee as the site of the day on <a href="http://www.webdesign.org/">WebDesign.org</a>.

It really does show how generous and how willing the Twitter community is willing to get involved, especially for a good cause. The money raised is going to <a href="http://sponsorlee.org/charity">Action for Kids</a>, a worthy charity who help disabled children.

Thanks to everyone who has sponsored me so far and thanks for all the tweets. Be sure to <a href="http://sponsorlee.org/#sponsors">check out the websites of sponsors to date</a>.
