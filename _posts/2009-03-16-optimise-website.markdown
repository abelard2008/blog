    on this topic?  Thanks!

    I have seen it demonstrated at two Adobe Creative Suite presentations and difference

    and charge lot of money for Photoshop."

    is to optimally split up your CSS and JS files. If you've got a section or page
    on your site that uses a lot of specialized CSS and JS code, split it up from
    the site-wide files so the other pages don't have to load all that code. This
    technique should be used with discretion though, because it does increase the
    number of requests."

Performance is something you don't often think about. You assume that if it loads quickly enough for you then everyone's happy. Someone commented a while back saying that it takes quite long for my pages to load so I optimised it a tad and thought I'd share a few quick tips with you.

<!--more-->

<h4>1. Use CSS sprites</h4>
Rather than having multiple CSS background images for your page, you can use CSS sprites to <strong>combine multiple images into one graphic</strong>. This <strong>reduces overall filesize</strong> and the amount of <strong>HTTP requests</strong>.

Once you do this you can use CSS to control the background images.

<pre><code>#services ol li{
background:url(images/homeicons.gif) no-repeat;
}

#services ol li.design{
background-position:0px -460px;
}</code></pre>

And as you can see the size and http requests are reduced considerably.
<div class="blog-img"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/sprites.gif" alt="Sprites" border="0" width="540" height="250" /></div>

<h4>2. Use an external CDN</h4>
A CDN is a content delivery network and it basically means <strong>use scripts that are hosted on other sites</strong>. Why? Because users might not have to download the script when they visit your site as it's already cached. 

Google has an <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/documentation/index.html">AJAX Libraries API</a> that you can use.

<pre><code><script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/prototype/1.6.0.3/prototype.js" type="text/javascript"></script></code></pre>

<h4>3. Install YSlow</h4>
YSlow is a very <strong>useful optimisation tool for Firefox</strong>. YSlow will report on any page you load up and will give you information about the amount of HTTP requests, CDNs used, CSS and JS compression and will give you a grade for each and tell you how to improve the page so it loads quicker.

<ul>
<li>First you need to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">install Firebug</a>. YSlow runs alongside this add-on.</li>
<li>Now <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5369">install YSlow</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2007/08/yslow-podcast-screencast.html">Watch this screencast</a> on how to use YSlow</li>
</ul>

<div class="blog-img"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/yslow.gif" alt="YSlow" border="0" width="409" height="201" /></div>


<h4>4. Put JavaScript at the bottom</h4>
Put any JS requests that you can at the bottom of your code, <strong>allowing your content to load first</strong>. This includes any <strong>Twitter</strong> or <strong>Analytics</strong> requests. This way your site content can load before trying to load external JS files.

<h4>5. Optimise graphics for web</h4>

<strong>Save your images for the web in Photoshop</strong> and you can alter the image quality, reducing the file size considerably. Of course I'd like to think you were doing this already ;-)

In Photoshop, File &gt; Save for web &amp; devices

<div class="blog-img"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/saveforweb.jpg" alt="Save for web" border="0" width="540" height="200" /></div>

<h4>More tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cache your pages - <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cache/installation/">Wordpress cache plugin</a></li>
<li>Make sure all your Javascript and CSS is external (not inline)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cssdrive.com/index.php/main/csscompressor/">Compress your CSS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://javascriptcompressor.com/">Compress your Javascript</a></li>
</ul>
