    Auto DMs piss people off.  #8 If you use all 140 characters no one will be able
    to retweet for you or you will make it such a pain in the ass no one will bother.
    \ #7 - If I see someone trying to get to a specific number of followers I know
    I don't mean crap to them and will usually unfollow. Richard Branson thinks you
    are a nobody so if he is following rule  #10... who are you going to chat with?\r\n\r\nInsincere
    participation is BS and if your ego needs that much stroking go back to MySpace."

  content: LOL what a load of crap! it would take you years to unfollow EVERYONE!
    plus i have a friend that has almost 1000 followers and she didn't even have to
    follow 10 people, only her friends. People follow you if you have INTERESTING
    TWEETS! They say tweet all the time so you get more followers, yes &amp; no because
    people get annoyed and UNFOLLOW YOU! so follow who you want to follow and ask
    people to follow you, quite easy &amp; simple :) Follow me @ www.twitter.com/BabyBecca0

  content: a lot of the "tips" seem more like spam ideas. tweet about everything?
    i'm shocked people justify it as a way to get more followers as it's not different
    for how a spammer works, and they justify that by the nice number in their bank
    account at the end of the week. in my opinion use twitter how you want to, if
    there is people to follow that you want to follow, then do so. some users will
    want to read the posts of someone with only a few people following as they are
    less likely to be spam, but some others wont, so don't be false and just be a
    true twitterer and the real customers will come running soon enough.

  content: So this article is a joke? In any event I find the replies hilariously
    self-indulgent and pretentious (the article too, if it's a joke). It seems to
    me that you "seasoned twitterers" have your heads up your a***s. You are taking
    yourselves waaaay too seriously. Tweeting isn't SERIOUS. It's just people - all
    kinds of people with different views - posting short messages. There are no rules.
    Making up rules about what is and isn't acceptable, and sniggering at people who
    neither know or care about these self-imposed rules, is just plain dumb. It's
    like saying you shouldn't wear certain colours, or you shouldn't begin sentences
    with "and". And I do that all the time.

  content: Thanks. This is a nice list ive seen. But i think the first one is the
    best. Get more followers, you have to spend time and follow people before they
    follow you. If you are the Rock, electrifying entertainer,  the great one (more
    than 1 million followers), YOu dont need to follow people. Thats why the Rock
    is rookie.

    ago from a site callled http://www.buildyoursocial.com and in the past week I
    have noticed an increase in sales on my website and alot of click I'm getting
    on my tweets now, so I think it's a good idea if you buy from the right place.

After reading this recent post from <a href="http://twitter.com/paddydonnelly">@paddydonnelly</a>, <a href="http://blog.iampaddy.com/2009/03/25/not-another-10-tips-to-get-more-twitter-followers-post/">Not Another ‘10 Tips to get more Twitter Followers</a>’, I felt compelled to write what I think is the best way to use Twitter for getting more followers.

Follow this surefire guide and you'll have hundreds (or even thousands) of more followers on Twitter in no time.

<a href="http://devumi.com/twitter-followers?ap_id=hbkmunroe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://devumi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/GMTF_468X60.jpg" alt="Get Real Twitter Followers – Fast and Easy" border="0" /></a>

<!--more-->
<h4>1. Follow everyone</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/t-follow.gif" alt="Follow everyonef" width="540" height="100" border="0" /></div>
How do you get noticed on Twitter? <strong>Follow everyone else</strong>. Literally go through as many Twitter profiles as possible and click follow. Do this 1,000 times and you'll get around 900 follows back.
<h4>2. Retweet like mad</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/t-rt.gif" alt="Retweet like mad" width="540" height="100" border="0" /></div>
<strong>Retweet every link that comes from your friends</strong>. First of all your friend will be thankful for the retweet and secondly your followers will be thankful for the shared link.

Be sure to retweet in the format "<strong>RT @friend:</strong>" and keep any other RT @friend references in so they get the credit they deserve.
<h4>3. Constantly tweet about what you're doing</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/d-toilet.gif" alt="Constantly tweet about what you're doing" width="540" height="100" border="0" /></div>
Nobody will follow you if your Twitter stream is lying static so make sure you constantly update it, every 15 minutes if possible.

If you're not doing anything interesting, <strong>talk about the food you're eating, what you're watching on TV or who you're talking to and meeting</strong> e.g. "Eating sushi with @myfriend while watching Family Guy".
<h4>4. Auto DM new followers to welcome them</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/t-dm.gif" alt="Auto DM new followers to welcome them" width="540" height="100" border="0" /></div>
You want your new followers to feel welcome so <a href="http://www.tweetlater.com">setup an auto welcome message via DM</a> to say <strong>"Thanks for following me". This is also the perfect time to list your sites that you want them to visit.</strong>
<h4>5. Link to your MySpace, Facebook or Bebo page</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1196" title="Facebook" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/t-bebo1.gif" alt="Facebook" width="540" height="100" /></div>
Twitter is a social networking site so when listing your website it's a good idea to link to another social networking site that you're on so friends can connect with you on that site also. <strong>Enter your MySpace, Facebook or Bebo site here</strong>, not your website or blog.
<h4>6. Ask people to Digg, Retweet, Bookmark, Float etc.</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/t-digg.gif" alt="Ask people to Digg, Retweet, Bookmark, Float etc." width="540" height="100" border="0" /></div>
This is the true value of Twitter. You can use it to gain significant advantages like asking people to digg your posts. <strong>If you have 500 followers and you ask them all to help you digg a post, you'll more than likely get at least 400 diggs and be featured on the Digg homepage.</strong>
<h4>7. Ask people to follow you</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/t-followers.gif" alt="Ask people to follow you" width="540" height="100" border="0" /></div>
<strong>Milestones are important on Twitter</strong>. There's a big difference between someone who only has 99 followers and someone who has 101 followers. You want and need to hit these follower milestones.

<strong>If you're at 90 followers, tweet "nearly at 100 followers" and before you know it you'll reach the 100 mark</strong> because your friends will retweet it. Likewise when nearing 1,000, 2,000 etc.
<h4>8. Use all 140 characters</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/t-140.gif" alt="Use all 140 characters" width="540" height="100" border="0" /></div>
Don't waste your tweets.<strong> There are 140 characters up for grabs so make sure you use as many as possible</strong>. The more information provided for your friends the better.
<h4>9. Don't give away your secrets</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/t-secret.gif" alt="Don't give away your secrets" width="540" height="100" border="0" /></div>
If you find a good link that helps you achieve something extraordinary in your field, it would be silly to share it on Twitter. Don't forget, <strong>your friends on Twitter are also your competitors</strong> so don't be giving your secrets away.
<h4>10. Don't reply to nobodies</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/t-celeb.gif" alt="Don't reply to nobodies" width="540" height="100" border="0" /></div>
You want people to think that you're really big and popular so <strong>only @reply to people who are famous or have thousands of followers</strong>. This will make you look like a Twitter big gun and people will feel the need to follow you.

<h4>What do you think?</h4>
<strong><em>Are these effective ways to use Twitter? Do you have any other recommendations?</em></strong>
