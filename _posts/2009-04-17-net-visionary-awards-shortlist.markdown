  content: "Hi Lee,\r\n\r\nRoseanne here from the IIA - we've tweeted some :) Thanks
    for the great blog post and no harm to draw everyone's attention to any area not
    being represented. As I said we are an all-island organisation but sadly the staff
    here are, of course, prohibited from nominating anyone for the awards so even
    if I thought you were a fabulous designer I personally could do nothing about
    it. I think we made enough noise about nominations to be heard in the North Pole
    never mind Northern Ireland but I will take it into account next year and redouble
    my efforts to make our announcements heard island-wide.\r\n\r\n@Paul Anthony -
    FYI that dropdown is populated depending on the content included by the members.
    If the members don't include their county, it's not included in the drop down.
    So it may not be a very clear representation of our member base up north. We have
    quite a few actually and I'm looking forward to a trip north in June - I'll let
    you know more about this closer to the time.\r\n\r\nTalk soon,\r\nRoseanne"

This year's Net Visionary Awards shortlist has been announced.

The Net Visionary Awards are an annual awards ceremony that celebrate the best in online business in Ireland.

Well done to <a href="http://iia.newsweaver.ie/17a0fnvesfl-18eifdvny3?email=true">all shortlisted</a> and I'm looking forward to hearing the results, but being a web designer the award that draws the most interest from me is for '<a href="http://www.iia.ie/net-visionary/vote/">Web Designer Excellence</a>'.

<h4>What about Northern Ireland?</h4>
As far as I can tell (correct me if I'm wrong) <strong>there are no Northern Ireland based businesses shortlisted</strong>, even though the Net Visionary Awards are for the whole of Ireland. Is the standard not as good up here? Are we not making as big an impact online? Was there just a lack of interest in the awards and no one was actually nominated? Or maybe it's because the majority of websites/services we use are based in England?

<em><strong>Let me know your thoughts on this.</strong></em>

In regards to web awards in NI, there used to be the <a href="http://goldeneye.businesseye.co.uk/">Goldeneye T Awards</a> , but judging by the standard of '<a href="http://goldeneye.businesseye.co.uk/website-of-the-month/">Websites of the month</a>' featured on their site, this hasn't been running for a couple of years.

Unless I'm mistaken, it looks like there's a gap for web awards for Northern Ireland (maybe another event for <a href="http://goodonpaper.org">@goodonpaper</a> to organise ;-) )
<h4>Net Visionary Awards</h4>
The <a href="http://www.iia.ie/net-visionary/vote/">IIA &amp; Enterprise Ireland Net Visionary Awards 2009</a> will be held on Thursday 21st May in the Crowne Plaza, Dublin Northwood.

<strong><em>Who do you think should win the web designer excellence award and what do you think of the shortlist?</em></strong>
