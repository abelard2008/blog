  content: Enjoyed the talk Lee, coming from the Drupal camp I have only had a brief
    look at Wordpress but all your points easily translate to any blogging/cms system.
    Looking forward to hearing how your legs are tomorrow...always the day after the
    day after that it bites....

    someone should definitely release an alternative plug-in.\r\n\r\nThe 'call to

    a must for bloggers. I also use author bios to get my readers to follow me on

  content: "Great compilation Lee,\r\n\r\nSo many bloggers and developers underestimate
    the power of SEO in generating new site traffic. Such an important tool is often
    disregarded during new theme design, but with the various 2.7+ compatible plugins
    available, there should really be no excuse!!\r\n\r\nSorry I missed your talk
    at #barcampbelfast, but have been otherwise engaged with various projects as of
    late. I'm glad this outline has been made available: it will act as a great reference
    point for not only new developers, but I aim to send both clients and associates
    a link to this article for emphasis on the points outlined above.\r\n\r\n*bookmarked*\r\n\r\nAll
    the best,\r\n\r\nLee Evans."

I had the pleasure of attending and talking at Barcamp Belfast on Saturday (25th April) before dashing off and getting a plane to <a href="http://results-2009.london-marathon.co.uk/index.php?lastname=munroe&amp;firstname=lee&amp;club=&amp;gender=&amp;nation=&amp;event_id=MAS&amp;position=&amp;split=FINISHNET&amp;Submit=show+results+%3E%3E&amp;a=d&amp;o=s&amp;start_no=33659&amp;ostart_no=#">London for the marathon</a>.

I had a great morning and going by feedback from others the whole day was a great success with some <a href="http://barcampbelfast.com/">fantastic speakers and over 350 attendees</a>. Well done to <a href="http://goodonpaper.org">Andy Good</a> for putting it together, along with all those who helped out. <a href="http://alaninbelfast.blogspot.com/2009/04/barcamp-belfast-2009-reflections.html">There's a good video montage of the day here</a>.

<h4>The 7 Deadly Sins of Wordpress</h4>
I got the ball rolling at 9.30am with my Wordpress talk, looking at <strong>7 ways to make your (Wordpress) blog more effective</strong>.

I thought that rather than put up my slides (which don't really make sense out of context) I'd give an overview of the 7 points and the solutions.
<h4>1. Backup</h4>
Assume things will go wrong and the time will come when you'll regret you didn't backup (<strong>server problems, site gets hacked, client/other user deletes stuff, you muck it up yourself</strong>)
<h5>Solution</h5>
<strong>Backup daily automatically</strong> with <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-db-backup/">WP-DB-Plugin</a>. Your backup will be emailed to you daily and you don't have to lift a finger.
<h4>2. Easy Comments</h4>
Make it as<strong> easy as possible for users to leave comments</strong>. Don't put a barrier in their way in the form of <strong>captchas</strong> or having to <strong>signup</strong> to leave a comment. These are used to stop spam, but there are better user friendly ways.
<h5>Solution</h5>
To stop spam, install and activate <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/akismet/">Akismet</a> (which will put spam in a spam folder) and verify comments before they're published.
<h4>3. URLS</h4>
The default URL for posts e.g. <strong>http://www.leemunroe.com/?p=1194</strong> doesn't mean anything to users or search engines.

<strong>http://www.leemunroe.com/tips-more-twitter-followers/</strong> means more to users (they now know what content is on that page) and <strong>search engines</strong> can allocate keywords to that page based on the url
<h5>Solution</h5>
Under <strong>Settings &gt; Permalinks</strong> click 'Custom structure' and enter <strong>/%postname%/</strong>. This will change your URL so it includes the article title.
<h4>4. Feed</h4>
Make sure your RSS feed link is easy to find. It should be clearly linked to i<strong>n your sidebar and should be in the browsers address bar</strong> also (this is a common convention and there are also applications that will find your feed going by the link in your head).

By default Wordpress will include this link, as will most themes, but if you're designing your own theme it can often be overlooked.
<h5>Solution</h5>
Put this code between your &lt;head&gt; tags:

<strong>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title=â€œTitle" href="link-to-feed" /&gt;</strong>
<h4>5. Actions</h4>
Once someone reads through your post it's up to you to <strong>point them in the right direction of what their next actions should be</strong>. They could add a comment, read other articles on your site, help promote the post, follow you on Twitter etc.
<h5>Solution</h5>
Use the following plugins to <strong>suggest actions at the end of your post</strong>. These will help keep users on your site reading other articles or help to promote your post via social networking sites.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/similar-posts/">Similar posts plugin</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/">Popular posts plugin</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/share-this/">Share this plugin</a> or <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sociable/">sociable plugin</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>6. SEO</h4>
For your posts to be found on Google they have to be well optimized. There are a few simple modifications you can make to help SEO.
<h5>Solution</h5>
Use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All In One SEO Pack</a> and you can <strong>set titles, descriptions and keywords</strong> for your homepage, posts and pages.
<h4>7. Text</h4>
On the web, people don't read they scan. You have roughly 3 seconds to grab the readers attention so your text should be easily read and scannable.
<h5>Solution</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Break blocks of text into smaller paragraphs</li>
	<li>Use meaningful sub headings</li>
	<li>Use lists where appropriate (bullet and numbered)</li>
	<li>Highlight (bold) keywords</li>
	<li>Make sure links stand out against other text</li>
	<li>Remove unnecessary waffle text</li>
</ul>
