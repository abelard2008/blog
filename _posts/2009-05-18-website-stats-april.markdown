  content: "Thanks for posting this, Lee. It's very helpful to analyze your stats
    frequently and see what may not be working and where you can improve your content,
    and it's certainly great to see the stats a website that has as many visitors
    as yours. I may do the same someday, even though I don't have this kind of traffic
    :)\r\n\r\n(And 3 IE5.5 users?!)"

  content: It's always interesting to see another website's stats so thanks very much
    for sharing. Stumbleupon.com is one of my highest referrers also and it often
    provides very good traffic i.e. people who look at more than one page of content.

  content: "Wow, thank you for sharing! Some numbers are really surprising for me.
    For example I thought you'll get much more from SM after guest post and mentions..\r\nAnd
    I'm wondering how did you get so much traffic from wordpress.org? You've made
    a plugin? Or taking participation in different discussions?\r\n\r\nP.S. \"There
    are people who still use IE6\" - it's our eternal damnation! And I think you'll
    say this even 5 years after.. =("

    IE6 hits weighed in at a hefty 17%. Researching your target audience and the technology
    they are likely to use is ESSENTIAL!

    when people will find this site by searching for 'horse boners'. It's happened
    before.\r\n\r\nAlso, 1280x800 is laptop screens, I just realized. I wonder if
    that means a fifth of your readers are using a laptop?\r\n(I'd be interested to
    hear how many 1920x1200 screens you have coming here.)"

    ended up on his testimonial page. \r\n\r\nMy guess is they didn't find what they

    But look at your bounce rate, average page view, time on site: 76%, 1.68 and 1.33.\r\n\r\nYou
    are attracting a bunch of low hanging fruit; those looking for \"free stuff\".\r\n\r\nThere's
    an expression that says \"Just because I have heard of cancer, doesn't mean I
    want it\"\r\n\r\nWhat's the point of all that traffic with generating business
    enquiries, leads and new business ?"

    Smashing Mag has sent a lot of traffic over the past few months, more so from
    the posts featuring my site. And the site is featured in the Wordpress gallery,
    hence the traffic from there http://wordpress.org/showcase/lee-munroe/\r\n\r\n@Michael
    Kozakewich: 4,937 with 1920x1200 resolutions (10%) and only 3 using 640x480\r\n\r\n@The
    Wee Guy: Agreed. Since my top referrers are stumble and twitter a lot of people
    arrive at the site, scan down the article and then leave, hence the high bounce
    rate. Business wise I think it helps to get your name out there. Each visit to
    your blog isn't going to convert into leads but constantly producing useful content
    and getting people to your site I find helps to promote your name and service."

    34%, Safari 17% on my blog and IE at 49%, Firefox 26%, Safari 19% on my main site.\r\n\r\nAgree
    most traffic is through the week, and that goes for the 30+ sites I manage and
    is not affected by age or profile of user. People at work!\r\n\r\ni always target
    client's email newsletters just before lunchtime and towards the end of the week
    when people might be getting a little bored.\r\n\r\nI used the browser size information
    to persuade several clients to go for new larger websites.\r\n\r\nInteresting
    post! Chris"

    the girlfriend will make me stay off the laptop on Sundays (but still feel the
    need to sneak on when she leaves the room ;-)\r\n\r\n@Chris: Yeah I have server
    stats, although the interface is ugly. Google does miss out on some stats so number
    wise it isn't accurate but I find the share/percentages are still the same. Nice
    trick on the email targeting"

Remember those days when people used to put website <strong>hit counters</strong> on their site (actually I still see this every so often)? These days we are more secretive about our stats, or we simply don't see the need to share them openly with the rest of the world.

After checking my Google Analytics account recently, I thought it might be of interest to publicise some of my findings. So I selected 1 month, <strong>April 1st - April 30th 2009</strong>, and here are the findings.

<h4>Content</h4>

<h5>Areas of interest</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The top 10 pages were:

	<li><a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/">Homepage</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/designing-out-of-the-box/">Designing out of the box</a></li>

</li>
	<li>Generally, the top 10 landing pages were the same as the top 10 exit pages, which were the same as the top 10 visited pages (therefore my bounce rate isn't very good)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
So what does all this mean?
<ul>
	<li>Constantly <strong>writing useful blog posts</strong> on your site is a good idea</li>
	<li>Writing <strong>guest posts</strong> for other sites can be useful</li>
	<li>Being <strong>active on Twitter</strong> matters</li>
	<li>Posting blog posts on the <strong>weekend isn't as effective as during the week</strong></li>
	<li>There are people who still use <strong>IE6</strong></li>
	<li>You can pretty much forget about having to design for 800x600 anymore. Most <strong>users have at least 1024x768</strong> and higher resolutions</li>
	<li>Remember people will access your site on different platforms, including <strong>mobile/iPhone</strong></li>
	<li>Submit your site &amp; posts to social sites like <strong>Delicious and Stumbleupon</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Twitter is a hot search topic</strong> at the minute</li>
</ul>
Of course these conclusions are only drawn from my readers. Things may be different for your site depending on your target market.

<strong><em>What are your stats like? What's the oddest thing someone has searched for to find your site? How many people use IE6? Please share below.</em></strong>
