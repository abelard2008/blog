Last week I went to Refresh Belfast and listened to the guys from <a href="http://www.designbyfront.com">Front</a>, one of Ireland's leading web development teams, talk about user experience and visual design among other things.

Here's a brief roundup.

<h4>What is Refresh Belfast?</h4>

Refresh Belfast is a monthly event for designers and creatives to meet over an informative talk and a 'refreshing' pint.

It takes place every third Monday of the month in <a href="http://lookaly.com/belfast/black-box/">The Black Box</a>, and like a lot of web related events happening in Belfast is organised by <a href="http://goodonpaper.org/">Andy Good</a>.

<h4>Who are Front?</h4>

<a href="http://designbyfront.com/">Front</a> are one of Ireland’s leading web development agencies with clients including BBC, O2, Independent News & Media, Carte Blanche Greetings – and lots of exciting new work they’re not yet able to speak about!

<a href="http://twitter.com/paulmckeever">Paul McKeever</a>, Front's MD, and <a href="http://twitter.com/jamneely">Jamie Neely</a>, Front's creative director, both spoke at the event.

<h4>Topics</h4>

Paul talked about the user experience, how people will use your site and being human online (and not talking like a robot). 

Jamie discussed Front's approach to design and how it's not about jumping into Photoshop and starting to design a site. It's about understanding the user and client needs, scoping out the project with wireframes and sketches and building the client's online brand.
