  content: "great article as ever lee. I had some thoughts on this myself \r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/t4omt
    \r\n\r\nMy personal view is to price IE6 into any freelance website build. Make
    a client aware of old browser support and offer the solution, but price the work
    accordingly."

    show that the browser is very much out of date. An interesting quote though from
    the Dear IE6 site:\r\n\r\n\"thank you for all the money you've made me. Countless
    hours of debugging, all paid!\"\r\n\r\nSeems like there are 2 sides to this debate
    after all..."

  content: "I'm with you Lee, and we seem to be in the minority when I read of countless
    designers ignoring ie6 because it's \"archaeic\" or \"past its sell by date\".\r\n\r\nThe
    fact is a large percentage of visitors to our site use ie6, for whatever reason,
    and we're a design company. How much higher percentage would that be for a site
    that doesn't get regular visits from the \"design community\" and their 30\" imacs?\r\n\r\nWe're
    losing business if we're snotty about it and say \"if you're using ie6 you don't
    deserve to see our site\". We'll continue to support ie6 as best we can but always
    warn clients that it is likely to display differently. They always seem to respect
    that.\r\n\r\nI was going to blog on this myself actually but I think that rant
    might have got it out of my system!"

  content: "w3schools browser stats still show a 14.5% share of the market for IE6.
    As designers we cannot justify excluding nearly 15% (or higher depending on sector)
    of potential users because it is an inconvenience to us.  If you do choose to
    justify that, do you also disregard accessibility standards - afterall, blind
    people make up far less than 15% of internet users and it is at least as big a
    job to cater to the disabled as it is to optimise for IE6.\r\n\r\nI agree that
    sometimes you have to accept that your site isn't going to display perfectly in
    every browser, but you should still give it a good try before writing it off as
    a bad job.  \r\n\r\nAnd besides, a shared hatred of IE6 brings the community closer
    together; if you ever find yourself strapped for an ice breaker at a web designer
    get together, just bring up IE6 and you're away."

  content: "This was a nice read Lee. \r\n\r\nI design for Firefox on a Mac. I also
    use the YUI library files; reset.css and base.css to neuralise browser specific
    rules for all Class-A browsers.  \r\n\r\nThis allows my designs to render correctly
    in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE7, IE8 and Opera on both Mac and Windows.  However,
    for IE6 I will check my designs but I will not spend any time adding hacks, fixing
    problems.  I have recently decided to start using a Print Stylesheet for IE6 users
    with a message explaining about the issues with IE6, encouraging the user to upgrade
    with a list of FREE alternatives. \r\n\r\nMy traffic stats for June so far shows
    that I have 6% of visitors still using IE6.  In May I had 8%.  I believe this
    drop was due to the ongoing campaign informing IE6 users to upgrade.\r\n\r\nSean"

    depends on the site's visitors. So campaigns that try to *make* visitors change
    will often be counter-productive.\r\n\r\nAs long as the site renders properly
    and looks something like the 'modern' browser version I can't see a problem with
    that. Most of the IE6 'quirks' are quite easy to iron out anyway: if you know
    you're designing for IE6 as well from the beginning it shouldn't cause a problem."

  content: "Web developers and designers (with our big screens and up-to-date systems)
    are a tiny, tiny percentage of the global web audience. What we might think about
    an outdated browser is a complete irrelevance to average users. They just want
    a website that works with the kit they've currently got.\r\n\r\nCurrent stats
    put the global number of users of IE6 as anything between 14.5% and 33% (w3schools
    and thecounter respectively). Look at all the screenshots that the BBC have of
    the Wimbledon website: all in IE6. We should pay heed to the numbers of users
    who simply can't upgrade.\r\n\r\nIt's true IE6 is a poor browser by today's standards,
    and I'd love to ignore it if I could. But I do my job and support it because,
    well, it's my job and anything else is a disservice both to my craft and my users.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s
    not my place to tell people what browser they should use and even if I could encourage
    them to ditch IE6, many are unable to as you point out.\r\n\r\nIf you believe
    in an open web, a level playing field and are a responsible designer who cares
    about his craft, then you have no option but to cater for IE6 in some way.\r\n\r\nI
    think Andy Clarke went too far with his global IE6 stylesheet approach -- very
    few clients will be prepared for anything that radical, whatever way you spin
    it.\r\n\r\nFor me, I make sure my sites are usable and reasonably similar in design
    and layout in IE6. Pixel perfection isn't required; Progressive Enhancement is
    a better prospect."

    enough market share to warrant support in some form.\r\n\r\nI support IE6 but
    firmly believe graceful degradation is the way forward and don't try and make
    it look identical to more better supported browsers.\r\n\r\nBecause of corporate
    IT policies and non computer literate people still using IE6 it will probably
    still need supporting for a while yet, maybe Windows 7 will bring with it a whole
    host of aged computers being upgraded finally and the market share of IE6 will
    reduce. The fact that no version of IE will ship with Windows 7 in Europe is good
    thing too, hopefully those that aren't aware of the existence of other browsers
    will finally see they have a choice. Assuming of course they even know what a
    browser is ;)."

    dynamic scripts that degrade well or offering alternative versions for IE6 and
    older is always good practise. I certainly don't think that designers should stop
    supporting it. A major part of website design is accessibility and it is not that
    difficult to achieve."

    lot of people who rant about IE6 are not that fully aware of the bugs and what
    causes them. I think if your aware of the bugs you can take it into consideration
    when building so that you can avoid as many errors as possible.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I am still learning about all the various bugs so more than likely my sites up
    until now will break in IE6 but hopefully I can fix that in later builds until
    we finally drop IE6."

    make a good few extra bucks :)\r\n\r\n@Adam: Possibly if all the major sites agreed
    to have a specific 'upgrade your browser' stylesheet for ie6 but the problem is
    it's only us designers that really seem to care (cos it makes life awkward for
    us).\r\n\r\n@Andrew: lol true, it is a bit snotty. And you don't know their situation.
    I'd be pissed if I was traveling and had to use a internet cafe or kiosk and I
    couldn't get onto the site I wanted to because the designers trying to be smart\r\n\r\n@James:
    ha, I'll use that as my next ice breaker \"so what about ie6?\"\r\n\r\n@Sean:
    That 2% drop is interesting - so it does seem to make a difference then?\r\n\r\n@Leon:
    \"Yes, the key is that some people *canâ€™t* change their browser.\" Exactly, although
    a lot of designers don't realise this\r\n\r\n@Matt: BBC using IE6 screen shots
    for Wimbledon, seriously? Yeah I think Andy Clarke's global stylesheet is too
    much. I can't imagine selling that to a client and wouldn't want any of my sites
    (unless it was a quirky site for designers only) looking that basic\r\n\r\n@Tim:
    \"no version of IE will ship with Windows 7 in Europe\" it will be interesting
    to see how this affects browser wars. Curious, is this the same in the US?\r\n\r\n@Dorothy:

    resort to degrading gracefully, in fact one of my sites currently has 30.20% of
    traffic from IE6, so although it's a pain in the a$$ unfortunately we still owe
    it to these users to present something that's at least functional. \r\n\r\nWith
    a bit of luck this will rapidly change with the release of Win7 as a lot of users
    have been reluctant to upgrade (?) to Vista. Fingers crossed!"

    extra for widely unsupported browsers at the client's request is one thing, but
    support for a browser that, while outdated, is in fact widely supported and used

    group or not. \r\n\r\nAs long as it looks decent and functions well in IE6, you're
    good. After that, raise awareness about the obsolete browser by incorporating
    something like this into your website: <a href=\"http://ie6update.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ie6update.com/#</a>.\r\n\r\nReally,
    it's Microsoft's responsibility to do that, but it looks like they're fine with
    wasting the time and money of web developers everywhere by making us have to use

  content: I stopped supporting IE6 last year. When I was weighing the percentage
    of users actually viewing my sites in IE6, versus the amount of time it took for
    me to style my websites and hack together a stylesheet to make IE6 look the same,
    I decided it wasn't worth it to either me or the client. I leave an option available
    to the client to amend the proposal to include it upon request, but I've written
    it into my contract at this point that, unless it's specified otherwise, IE6 is
    not tested.

Us designers love a good rant about IE6. And why not? Everything looks perfect in Firefox, Safari, even IE7 and 8. <strong>Then you open up IE6 and everything is a mess.</strong> In an ideal world no one would use IE6 anymore (and all browsers would render websites the same way).

But at the same time I do get sick of IE6 rants and campaigns. This isn't a rant, it's more of a '<strong>be aware that it still exists and some reasons why it still exists</strong>' post. A recent blog post of mine <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/design-blog-stats/">researching popular design blog analytics</a> showed that there are still 3% of users using IE6. And that's in the field of design. There is more than likely a lot more than that in terms of the World Wide Web.

<!--more-->

<h4>Why people are still using IE6</h4>

<ul>
<li>They use a company computer and have no control over upgrades</li>
<li>They've popped into an Internet cafe and have to use what's available</li>
<li>It works for them so why change</li>
<li>They don't realise there are other browsers available</li>
<li>They like it</li>
</ul>

So rather than campaigning to get people to upgrade their browser, shouldn't we just deal with it and support it?

<h4>But what does 'support' mean?</h4>

I think Andy Clarke hits the nail on the head in his <a href="http://24ways.org/2008/contract-killer">killer contract</a>:
<blockquote>We will also test to ensure that pages will display visually in a â€˜similarâ€™, albeit not necessarily an identical way, in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 for Windows as this browser is now past itâ€™s sell-by date.</blockquote>

I think this is the best way to support IE6: <strong>it doesn't have to be pixel perfect but the content should be accessible and it should look similar</strong>.

What I'll usually do before launching a site is check to <strong>make sure all the links are visible and clickable and all the content is accessible in IE6</strong>. I'll even spend 30 minutes to make sure it looks 'half decent' with regards to IE6 not supporting PNG transparency, which involves <strong>replacing the PNG backgrounds with GIFs via an IE6 specific stylesheet</strong>.

<h4>Supporting IE6</h4>

To specifically target IE6 users with special instructions or styles, use the following code.

<pre><code>

<!--[if IE 6]>
Special instructions for IE 6 here, usually including a specific IE6 stylesheet
<![endif]-->

</code></pre>

Anything placed between the special tags will only be recognised by IE6.

Hopefully over the next year or two we will be seeing less and less of IE6, especially if Microsoft encourage users to upgrade to IE8.

<strong><em>Do you 'support' IE6? Do you check to make sure your sites work? Do you spend much time fixing it or making it pixel perfect?</em></strong>
