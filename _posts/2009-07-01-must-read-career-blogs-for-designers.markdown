Keeping an eye out for your career’s future is important for everyone.
However, <strong>for web designers, looking forward may be even more important than for many other professions</strong>. Many web designers are freelancers, or work for more than one company at a given time. Jobs can be short or long term contracts, so <strong>looking for the next job is often not too far out into your future.</strong>
