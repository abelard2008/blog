    Reader, to keep all the blogs I want to read close at hand.\r\n\r\nAnd, something
    that needs cleared out now and then is bookmarks/favourites in your web browser.
    \ This can also make keeping up with the news, competitors, events, that much
    easier.\r\n\r\nThankfully, I've implemented everything on your list already. Made
    me feel quite satisfied with myself!  Hehe."

  content: "@Jacob: Sorry Jacob, I probably rambled off a few things I should have
    clarified. Basically when I am approached by a potential client, I will send them
    a website planner. This planner is a Word document and asks them several questions
    about their project, which allows me to gather their requirements e.g. What does
    your business do? How will you determine if this project is a success etc. After
    reading through this I then have a basic overview of the project, how much time
    it will take, how much it will cost etc.\r\n\r\nSo I have a ready made Word document
    that I'm able to email."

    it's getting all this praise, it is plain and simple common sense to get these
    tasks completed while still getting your work done. Also, why is this blog full
    of lists? Surely when you have more lists than actual ( by traditional standards
    ) blog content, then you're IMO you're just hit hunting and fishing for google
    positions..\r\n\r\nBut each to their own, I'm just not sure the blogging scene
    should be going this route for hits.. How about just pumping out good work and
    saving time by not writing these boring lists."

    are. Sometimes though it's good to share your experience and get the common sense
    techniques down 'on paper' so to speak.\r\n\r\nThis blog does contain a lot of
    lists, reason being I'm a big fan of lists. They're easy to read and you can get
    a lot out of them just by scanning your eye over them if you don't have the time
    for an in depth read. It's perfectly reasonable if you're not a fan of the blog,
    but the option is there if you want to read it or not."

    )  \r\n\r\nI don't choose not to read your blog mainly because it's not a terrible
    blog, I'd just like to see a bit more; either personal content or something that
    isnt a redux from smashing magazine from someone that is obviously creative who
    is from the higher tier on the social side of web-design and dare i say it, '
    2.0 ' esque blogosphere."

  content: "With newsletters - I use filters (a different filter for each newsletter),
    this way it allows me to scan the newsletters when I have time.\r\n\r\nFilter
    email - use filters to isolate emails from different clients and use them to separate
    friends from business. This way when you check your email you can quickly see
    who has sent you an email.\r\n\r\nAuto responders - if you are busy for a day
    or two, use an auto responder. Better to let a person know that you have received
    their email, but you are busy at the moment and will get back to them later.\r\n\r\nChecking
    Email - use your email client only to check your email at certain times of the
    day. That way you will not forget to check it."

    There are certain things that I have to type and retype on a daily basis. It really
    helps speed things up.

    If you manage alot of profiles in Google analytics a sudden drop in traffic can
    act as a red flag. For instance if one of your sites got hacked, you'll need to
    be aware of this asap and checking analytics will alert as quickly as everything.\r\n\r\nAlso
    if you are emphasizing product support and rapid response, checking your email
    twice a day isn't great support."

  content: I am not freelancer (yet) so I had to implement working early mornings
    so I could get things done. Getting up 5am gives you 2-3 good hours to work on
    your own projects and it starts your day nicely. thanks..

There are a lot of daily tasks a freelance web designer will go through:

<ul>
<li>Going through emails</li>
<li>Sending website planners to potential clients</li>
<li>Reading and replying to returned website planners</li>
<li>Quoting people for services</li>
<li>Sending proposals</li>
<li>Replying to current clients about different enquiries</li>
<li>Going through new Twitter followers</li>
<li>Tweeting</li>
<li>Approving blog comments</li>
<li>Replying to friends</li>
<li>Writing blog posts</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

After going through all these daily tasks, it can be very easy to see your day come and go without getting any 'real' work done. 

When I finished University and started freelancing full time <strong>I found myself getting caught up with these daily tasks</strong> so I went about making some changes and trying to find a more effective way of dealing with them. <strong>Here are several techniques I use for getting more done.</strong>

<!--more-->

<h4>Email</h4>

<h5>Cancel blog comment alerts</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/comments.jpg" alt="comments.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="60" /></div>

Cancel any automatic email alerts from your various blogs. This means you're not notified of any new comments or any comments waiting approval.

Instead, <strong>put these on a 'To-Check' list so when you have 5 minutes free in the morning/evening, you can check these sites for comments</strong>. This saves you being concerned with checking throughout the day.

<h5>Unsubscribe to newsletters</h5>
You probably get a lot of newsletters through to your email, most of which you have no interest in. It can be easy to delete/ignore them but instead make an effort to unsubscribe to any that are no use. This way they don't clutter up your inbox at all.

<h5>Check email twice a day</h5>
This is a hard one and I'm still getting used to it. <strong>Ideally you should only check your emails twice per day</strong>. The ideal times are <strong>12pm and 4pm </strong>(unless you're expecting an important email/reply). 

This <strong>gives you time in the morning to concentrate on work already planned</strong> and also lets you correspond with anyone between 12 & 4. No in-between wasting time. <strong>Every time you check your email it takes up a few seconds or even minutes so it's good practice to batch process this.</strong>

The best way to accomplish this is to <strong>keep your mail app, Gmail etc. closed</strong>.

<h5>Use templates</h5>

As a freelance web designer I get a lot of requests for quotes or to see if I'm interested in taking on a project. To let me find out more about a project I will send out a website planner to gather requirements. 

<strong>Rather than writing the same email everytime you receive an enquiry, have a template that you can use</strong>. This way you can copy and paste the template into the reply, and simply add the senders name at the start to personalise it.

Some email templates you should have to hand (as a freelance web designer):
<ul>
<li>I'd like to find out more, please complete this website planner</li>
<li>Sorry but I'm busy until...</li>
<li>Proposal and estimate attached</li>
</ul>

And of course <strong>have Word (or similar) templates ready for your proposals, contracts, invoices</strong> etc. Any document that you're going to need more than once.

<h4>Twitter</h4>

<h5>Tweet in advance</h5>

I like to share interesting links and articles with my followers and usually I'll find these links while going through my RSS reader. But if I'm checking my feeds first thing in the morning, it's a bit of a waste to tweet all the interesting links at once that early. So how do I spread out my tweets? I use Tweet Later.

<a href="http://www.tweetlater.com">Tweet Later</a> is a useful service that lets you set a time to publish your tweet. Very handy for spreading out all those useful tweets throughout the day. <a href="http://rtweeter.com/">RTweeter</a> is another new Twitter app that lets you schedule tweets.

<h5>Use Tweetdeck to filter your Twitter friends and replies</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://tweetdeck.com/beta/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/tweetdeck1.jpg" alt="Tweetdeck" border="0" width="540" height="139" /></a></div>

It's hard to keep track of what everyone is doing on Twitter if you follow more than 100 people. Using <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/beta/">Tweetdeck</a> you can <strong>setup filters which will group particular users into 1 column</strong>. This way you can keep track of the <strong>designers you're interested in or keep track of local tweets, keywords or business related words</strong> that you're interested in. 

<h5>Cancel Twitter follower alerts</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/twitter.jpg" alt="Twitter" border="0" width="540" height="251" /></div>

This also comes down under email distractions. <strong>Turn off automatic emails for new followers but make a point of checking your new followers at 1 point during the day</strong>. Again an example of batch processing a task.

<h4>Blogs</h4>

<h5>Read blog posts for 1 hour in the morning/night</h5>
It's crazy how many interesting blog posts there are out there and it takes forever to go through them. <strong>Go through your RSS reader for 1 hour in the morning instead of receiving alerts throughout the day</strong>.

But what about all the interesting links appearing on Twitter during the day? Usually all these posts may appear in your reader too but if there's a particularly interesting one <strong>drag it into a 'To read' folder saved in your browser favourites</strong>.

<h5>Only check analytics once a week</h5>
It's very easy to get drawn into checking analytics multiple times a day. It's always good to see your visitor count go up.

But instead of wasting your time checking all your websites stats daily, <strong>its much more useful to check at the end of every week and every month as this gives you a better bulk overview of your true stats</strong>. 

<h5>Use a desktop blogging app to continuously write notes for blog posts</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/mars.jpg" alt="MarsEdit" border="0" width="540" height="179" /></a></div>

Using <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> you can continuously take notes for different blog posts throughout the week, then when you have time take a look at all of the blog post ideas you've jotted down and finish one before publishing it. This works a lot better than sitting down to a blank canvas and MarsEdit saves you having to open up your Wordpress admin area each time.

<h4>How do you get things done?</h4>

These are some of the techniques I have introduced to getting things done.

<strong><em>Are there any special tips or techniques you will use to get things done?</em></strong> I would still like to get more work done during the day so it would be great if you could contribute some suggestions.
