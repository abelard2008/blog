  content: I also love to read other people's design process and I can say that your's
    is awesome. I particularly like the 3 columns homepage with great use of whitespace.
    Great job and inspiration.

  content: "Thank you so much for sharing your process. I agree that it's always interesting
    to read how others approach the process. Since I'm a web content writer, I start
    as you do with an analysis of the client's needs and the performance of their
    current website (if they have one). Then I gather up a team -- PM, designer, etc.
    -- if they don't have their own. I work with the designer to develop the information
    architecture, write the content, and send it along to the designer. Sometimes
    that's the end for me.\r\nIf we're managing the site, we go on through the mockup
    (some of the designers I work with do wireframes first and some don't)and building
    the site, and then we work with the webmaster to launch the site, check for any
    problems, submit the site to search engines and appropriate directories, and keep
    an eye on the analytics for a while."

  content: "My process usually changes around the point you build your site maps and
    IA. When thinking about the IA I also like to lay out how much time I target to
    spend on a specific task, like building wire frames, mock ups, and sometimes get
    down to specifying exactly how much time should be spent on coding and development
    of certain sections of the site.\r\n\r\nThis process allows me to gauge \r\n1)
    Efficiency \r\n2) True cost to myself\r\n\r\nThis process not only encourages
    me to complete tasks on time and eliminate distractions, it also ends up impacting
    the cost to client and future project quotes. Obviously no two projects are alike,
    but this can give you a ballpark depending on project depth."

    to complete, although from the point I handed over the design to the point the
    site went live there was about 3 months.\r\n\r\n@Courtny: Good thinking! I guess
    this is something I keep in mind (or at least I keep the quote in mind when making
    out IA and wireframes so I don't include anything that costs a lot more). Thanks

    Balsamiq [http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups] is great for wireframes, it
    stops them being old and boring and (I find) it engages the client far more when
    they see something that isn't as plain as the wireframe you show. My clients definately
    prefer the wireframes made with balsamique over my old ones!\r\n\r\nNot only that,
    balsamiq allows you to create wireframes very quickly and it gives you ideas as
    your creating them at the same time!\r\n\r\nPigeon (and no, i dont work for them!)"

  content: Hey Lee, great work. My question may look little strange, but it's really
    important for me. My interest is how do you charge your clients? For example how
    much you took for this project, reviewed here? You know, I live in the country
    of so called Third World (what's that supposed to mean? or what are a first two?..),
    where the whole site can be done just for $100. I constantly have a feel that
    I undercharge my clients (I'm coder) - they always are so happy to hear how much
    they have to pay me...

    to understand the client and their market. The best thing you can do is to ask
    questions, and keep asking questions. I will ask 'Why?' a lot or 'How will this
    benefit your users?'.\r\n\r\n@James: Usually only 1 concept. I only factor 1 concept
    into the quote. I don't believe in providing several concepts - your entire effort
    and expertise goes into producing the first concept so it must be the best based
    on your research. Fair enough though if the client comes back and they don't like
    it, you may have to take another stab at it (and charge for it), but I don't do
    more than 1 for them to compare at first.\r\n\r\n@Efraim: <a href=\"http://www.MockupMagnets.com\"

  content: "Great post! I thought I would share my cheat sheet of client questions.
    A lot are similar to yours but there are a few extra marketing related questions
    that you may find interesting: -\r\n\r\nWebsite Questions\r\n\r\n1. What is the
    website for?\r\n\tBrochure, E-commerce, Business card, reinforcement\r\n\t\t[Why:
    to see what the site need to include and what technologies should be involved]\r\n\r\n2.
    Who are the customers?\r\n\tMale, Female\r\n\tAge range\r\n\tWhat do they do\r\n\tWhat
    is their job title\r\n\t\t[Why: to try to profile the customer so that site design
    and content can be created to suit the audience]\r\n\r\n2a. Who is the competition?\r\n\t[Why:
    so we can look at their sites and see what we can learn about keywords, expected
    layout etc]\r\n\t\r\n\r\n3. How would you expect the customer to find the site?\r\n\tSearch,
    word of mouth, literature/business card\r\n\t\t[Why: to see how much emphasis
    needs to be placed on SEO/SEM]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. If search, what would they be looking
    for to find the site?\r\n\t\t[Why: so that keywords can be checked to see if there
    are more available]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. What sort of device would they use to access
    the site?\r\n\tPC, netbook, phone\r\n\t\t[Why: to see what technologies need to
    be involved/avoided, to look at creating specific content for a device]\r\n\r\n6.
    Where would they typically access the site from?\r\n\tOffice, home, out and about
    (using public wifi or mobile connection)\r\n\t\t[Why: to see how much bandwidth
    the site can take without inconveniencing the user]\r\n\r\n7. Are you geographically
    based?\r\n\tWhat are the limitations you want to put on area.\r\n\t\t[Why: to
    make sure content is written to make this clear, make sure Google is aware of
    this and to see what type of hosting is required]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. What type of site
    are you thinking about?\r\n\tExamples of sites that you like.\r\n\tWhat do you
    like about these sites?\r\n\t\t[Why: to get an idea of what you expect from the
    site]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. What tone do you want to set with the site?\r\n\tProfessional
    (typically more subdued), light hearted, fun\r\n\t\t[Why: to make sure that the
    tone of writing matches that of other literature or the image the company is portraying]\r\n\r\n10.
    Do you have other literature/business cards?\r\n\t\t[Why: so we can make sure
    the site matches the style and creates a total company image]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Would
    you want to be able to edit the site content?\r\n\tAll content, a blog, social
    media\r\n\t\t[Why: to see what technologies we need to use and what you expect
    from updates]\r\n\r\n12. What timeframe and budget is the site required in?\r\n\t[Why:
    Timeframe will set what is there is time to do in terms of design and interaction,
    also whether the designer can actually do it or not. Budget will set again set
    what is possible to do].\r\n\t[Note: Budget is always tricky as the client will
    not want the designer to design to a budget. Possibly ask for a range, or look
    at requested features and say roughly what each will cost].\r\n\r\nI'll try to
    post these up with more detail on my blog in the next few days."

    the customer. It's all been desribed 105 times already.\r\n\r\nAnd what is this
    stupid trend with white text on black background. Totally unreadable. I couldn't
    finish your post just because it's so difficult to read. When will people finally

    it here http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200608/light_text_on_dark_background_vs_readability/\r\n\r\nAnd

  content: "Wow Johnny, we must have caught you on a bad day! Yes you are right, a
    lot of these things are obvious to you and maybe to me, but read the comments
    above, not to everyone!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I agree with you about the white on
    black either. For one thing its actually grey, but with enough contrast for me
    at least to read comfortably without it being glarey (and I'm willing to bet I
    am both older and have worse eyes than you do). \r\n\r\nAs for the notification,
    this is really personal choice. I actually prefer to see follow up emails, you
    obviously don't. The check box is there so feel free to use it. Maybe the blog
    designer has actually done the research and found that a higher proportion wanted
    the followup than not. You never can tell!\r\n\r\nAnyway, you probably won't read
    this (as you won't get the email), but I hope your having a better day today;-)"

  content: "@Johnny: Thanks for your feedback, I do appreciate both positive and negative
    reactions. When I decide what to blog about I basically blog about stuff that
    interests me, so for example, as mentioned I like reading the design process of
    others. Sometimes I'll learn a new trick or sometimes it's just good to see if
    others are using the same process. So I thought this topic would be useful to
    other designers.\r\n\r\nI take your comment on board about the text on dark background.
    Do you have poor eye sight out of interest? Will keep that in mind for future
    redesigns.\r\n\r\nThe comment subscribe is auto checked as I think it's good for
    you to be automatically informed about new comments if you have contributed to
    a discussion. As Simon says, the option is there to uncheck and there is always
    an option in your email alert to unsubscribe.\r\n\r\n@ThinkBohemian: Sorry about
    the confusion. The logo I used for the mockup was their old logo - this let me
    move on with the project while Graham was designing the new logo. The end result
    uses the new logo.\r\n\r\n@Simon: Thanks for sharing your planner questions. I
    think \"How would you expect the customer to find the site?\" is a good one -
    often the marketing plan or promotion of the site is overlooked, forgotten or
    left until after launch."

    approach their projects. Very insightful!
---
I've always found it interesting reading the design process of others (<a href="http://www.davidairey.com/logo-design-for-giacom/">David Airey</a>, <a href="http://www.contrast.ie/blog/evolving-ideas/">Contrast</a>, <a href="http://www.thedesigncubicle.com/2009/07/a-special-need-logo-design-process/">Brian Hoff</a>). It's good to have an insight into others work, to see if I can learn anything from their process but also for curiosity. So I've put together a break down of my design process, using a recent project as a real life example, <a href="http://newsgroupdirect.com">Newsgroup Direct</a>.

<!--more-->
<h4>Overview</h4>
I was recently hired by Newsgroup Direct (NGD), a leading <a href="http://newsgroupdirect.com">Usenet newsgroup service provider</a>, to revamp their website, make it more modern and improve signups.
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/old.jpg" border="0" alt="Old" width="540" height="678" /></div>
Here is their previous design.
<h4>Planning</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/planner.gif" border="0" alt="Planner" width="540" height="200" /></div>
The first thing that happens when I get an enquiry is I <strong>send the potential client a website planner</strong>. The website planner, a series of questions I have listed in a Word document, will gather requirements for the project.

The key objectives of the planner:
<ul>
	<li>Find out <strong>who</strong> the client is and what they do</li>
	<li>Who their <strong>target market/user</strong> is</li>
	<li>Who their <strong>competition</strong> is</li>
	<li>What <strong>deliverables</strong> they want from me</li>
	<li><strong>Timeframe</strong> and <strong>budget</strong></li>
</ul>
In a nutshell, NGD require a makeover with a modern &amp; easy to use interface. <strong>I am responsible for the XHTML/CSS templates</strong> for the main pages (they already have a development team in place for the back-end programming &amp; integration).
<h4>Research &amp; Ideas</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ideas.gif" border="0" alt="Ideas" width="540" height="200" /></div>
<h5>Current site</h5>
I start by going through the <strong>current website</strong> and list things that can be improved.

Various issues raised for NGD include non-semantic markup, no defensive design, markup was invalid, poor Google ranking for keywords, no signup enticement, overload of available sign up options and several usability issues.
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/package.jpg" border="0" alt="Packages" width="540" height="241" /></div>
NGD had over 40 packages to choose from, which can be too overwhelming for the average user.
<h5>Competitors sites</h5>
The next stage is to analyse <strong>competitor websites; what is good or bad about them</strong>. If I can take on board what is good and eliminate what is bad, then there's a better chance of coming up with a successful solution.
<h5>Ideas</h5>
I <strong>suggest several improvements that can be made</strong> to the current site, showcase various <strong>features of other non-related sites</strong> that I feel can be integrated into the new site.

Several ideas I have for NGD:
<ul>
	<li>Clear <strong>instructions</strong> on how to use NGD and setup newsreaders for novice users</li>
	<li>New <strong>logo</strong> to reflect new branding</li>
	<li>Narrow down the <strong>packages</strong> (introduce a free package for trial)</li>
	<li>Clear <strong>call to actions</strong></li>
	<li>Highlight the key features of NGD with a slide reel in the header</li>
</ul>
<h5>Logo</h5>
Depending on the project new branding may be necessary including logo, stationary, company image and the website.

To help with their new online branding, <strong>I recommended NGD have a new logo designed</strong> &amp; I suggested a couple of professional logo designers I know or have worked with. They went with <a href="http://imjustcreative.com/">Graham Smith</a>, a well respected and well known graphic designer from the UK.

Graham did a great job with the logo and this was the final outcome.
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/logo.jpg" border="0" alt="Logo" width="350" height="100" /></div>
<h4>Information Architecture &amp; Sitemap</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ia.jpg" border="0" alt="IA" width="540" height="200" /></div>
I should mention here that at each stage I <strong>get feedback from the client and discuss it</strong>. It's important to make sure they're involved the whole way through the process.

For IA I jot down every section of the website on post-its and arrange them (on a wall or fridge) in <strong>order of importance</strong>. This is an great technique (that I was first introduced to by <a href="http://www.designbyfront.com">Front</a>) that allows you to easily change and rearrange your order. In the end you will end up with various levels of importance, which will <strong>help with your sitemap and wireframes</strong>.

Once I settle on the IA I produce a sitemap. I usually produce the <strong>sitemap in Illustrator</strong>. The reason I use Illustrator is it allows me to move pages about (unlike using paper) and it also produces a professional outcome that I can pass onto the client, but there are various other tools you can use.
<h4>Wireframes</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/wire.jpg" border="0" alt="Wireframes" width="540" height="200" /></div>
I start by <strong>sketching wireframes</strong> and then move onto <strong>Illustrator</strong> to produce more professional looking wireframes that I can pass onto the client and depending on the project I could produce 1, 2 or 3 wireframes.

For NGD I only produced 1 that was the homepage as this is the most important page while I kept the other pages (pricing, info pages etc.) as paper sketches.
<h4>Mockups</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/mockup.jpg" border="0" alt="Mockups" width="540" height="200" /></div>
Once the client is happy with the wireframes it is time to <strong>open Photoshop and start with a fresh canvas</strong>. The good thing about this process is that <strong>I now have a wireframe to build the design over</strong>.

Some key things to keep in mind here:
<ul>
	<li>Branding - tying in with the overall brand, <strong>colours</strong>, mood</li>
	<li>Target audience - NGD's audience are <strong>20-35yr old males</strong> so it has to appeal to them</li>
	<li>Grid - keeping the elements structured and to a <strong>grid system</strong> is important</li>
	<li>Development - bare in mind this has to be produced in <strong>CSS</strong> so don't make anything too complicated and keep graphics minimal</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/mockup1.jpg" border="0" alt="mockup.jpg" width="540" height="791" /></div>
Homepage mockup
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/markup.jpg" border="0" alt="Markup" width="540" height="200" /></div>
All good to go, the front end development process starts and I produce templates for:
<ul>
	<li>Homepage</li>
	<li>About Us</li>
	<li>Pricing</li>
	<li>Sign Up</li>
</ul>
I also produce a template that has various other styled elements that the NGD developers can use if need be, which includes tables, forms, buttons, alerts etc.
<h4>Completion</h4>
The project is complete and the templates are then passed onto the client (in this case NGD's development team to integrate into the framework).

After launch I will still <strong>monitor the analytics</strong> and make suggestions on how to improve the site and conversion rate. It's hard (or impossible) to get it perfect first time, <strong>there are always things you can learn from how the users use the site and make improvements based on this</strong>.

<h4>What's your process involve?</h4> 

Insights are always interesting and useful. Even if you're not a web designer, it's good to hear how projects develop.
