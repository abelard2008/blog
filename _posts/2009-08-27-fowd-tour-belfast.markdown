Thanks to <a href="http://carsonified.com">Carsonified</a> I'm speaking at the <strong>Future of Web Design Tour in Belfast on Wednesday 2nd September 2009</strong>.

The Belfast event is being held in <a href="http://lookaly.com/belfast/odyssey-arena/">W5 at The Odyssey</a> starting at 8.45am.

<a href="http://www.amiando.com/fowdtour2009.html">Tickets are still available at £59</a> (bargain for a FOWD event).
