  content: I'm struggling with the same question at the moment for littleQuiz.com.
    I think I'll leave in two fields for now, and test how it goes when I later remove
    the verify field. I know Facebook has been doing something similar, they defo
    had a verify field in their signup a few months back.

  content: "You could go the route of that other age-old question, do you need to
    star out the password in anything but the most security dependent applications?\r\n\r\nThe
    chances of anyone looking over your shoulder when signing up for Twitter or similar
    are so low, you could probably greatly reduce the mistyped password issue by letting
    the user see it as they enter it. Let the user visually confirm they have entered
    the correct password rather than machine verifying it.\r\n\r\nIn the case of banks
    etc, I think the double password is a good thing as the potential issues of being
    locked out of your bank website is a lot more than those of being locked out of
    Twitter."

  content: "Definitely not needed, and the chances are if you couldn't spell it correctly
    a few seconds before in the first field you won't spell it correct in the second.\r\n\r\nThe
    thing is though... if you removed now at this stage, after people have got used
    to it, then you may get some \"password paranoia\" when they're signing up. So
    in that sense some may argue that it is good to give users peace of mind about
    the password they entered."

    was developed an recruitment website a few years ago where I also provided technical

    of the job seekers failing to login to their account as they would enter the password
    after registering.  This also resulted in a large number of duplicate accounts
    been created! \r\n\r\nHowever after we included a confirm password field, we saw
    a decrease in the number of first time login failures...."

  content: "Part of any design process it to ensure the user has a positive experience
    when visiting your site so by adding a confirmation it reduces the issue of mistyping
    and when they return they have to trial and error their password until they get
    it right or reset their password again if they can not remember it, which can
    put the user from using the site or service again (in the worst case)\r\n\r\nBut
    the other part of the design process is to reduce the customers workload with
    non sale enquiries which distract the owner from making money, the reason the
    site is there for in the first place.\r\n\r\nNow this is not to say joe bloggs
    will not forget their password, but if there is a way to reduce this from happening,
    it should be implemented, in my opinion anyway!\r\n\r\nNice article."

    if a password field is required, I think 2 are required. As other people have
    posted here, it is common for users to mis-type it and then raise a support call
    about it (instead of using the 'retrieve password via e-mail option).\r\n\r\nOn
    http://www.stackoverflow.com, all registered users are required to have an OpenID
    account. On http://www.getmecooking.com we have provided both options (OpenID
    plus standard username and password). On GetMeCooking I would prefer all users
    to log on with an OpenID account, however because it has a wide, non-technical
    audience, we know that some people might not have an OpenID account."

    Don't know about the no starring out of passwords - risky.\r\n\r\n@Sean: Good
    to see some 'proof' of it's usage\r\n\r\n@Techboy: OpenID is certainly useful
    for 'techies' and I like the idea of having both options.\r\n\r\nIs it common
    for users to contact help rather than clicking the forgotten password link themselves?"

    I think this is more evident in an office environment - on the Internet users
    will just give up or find another similar website."

    that faster?\r\n\r\nYes, for the technically savvy, that 5 seconds of repeating
    a password which you probably can enter blindfolded with both hands tied behind
    your back may be a nuisance. \r\n\r\nBut for those who are not you, the confirm
    password field helps ensure that your users are not making a critical mistake
    that will immediately prevent them from using your website.\r\n\r\nSo, 5 seconds
    of extra typing, or users leaving your website because they cannot get signed
    in...which is the better end result?"

  content: "Re: David Lowry\r\n\r\nDo you think there is some sort of form encoding
    with a password input form element?  As far as the HTTP request being sent, the
    password and text input types are absolutely identical.  Also, as for the browser
    remembering entered passwords, there are HTML 5 attributes that prevent autocomplete
    from working that all browsers with that functionality from saving that value.
    \ No security hole there either.\r\n\r\nThat said, even though Jakob Nielsen has
    suggested it as the best practice to move towards (and I agree completely), there
    is the user trust factor to take into account.  This is why when I convince my
    clients to go this route, part of the design includes a small link next to the
    password textbox that states something along the lines of \"why is my password
    shown in plain text?\" which pops up a small inline box explaining why it is this
    way and how there is no security problem while doing so.  It is also important
    to follow Nielsen's recommendation completely here, which is to include a checkbox
    to \"hide my typing\", which converts the characters to the discs (or anything
    else, really).  With this mechanism, you can even easily do what someone above
    suggested, which is to mimic what the iPhone does."

    for the non-tech savvy users it gives them assurance and also cuts down mistakes,
    based on several of your experiences.\r\n\r\nDoes it depend on your target market
    then? Let's say a web app aimed at 'techies' or as Sean mentioned those with passwords
    who 'can enter blindfolded with both hands tied behind your back' could do without
    confirmation but more general apps towards all users should have confirm passwords?\r\n\r\nOpen
    ID and other SSO solutions are getting more popular and are potentially the best
    solution going forward, skipping sign up completely."

    are strong yet easy to remember. Rules such as requiring 6 characters, with letters
    and numbers are not the best way to create a strong password.

This is something I'm curious about and something I'd like to get your feedback on. <strong>Do you need to confirm passwords on sign up?</strong>

<!--more-->

<h4>It's an extra field</h4>
For me, I don't think you do need to confirm your password. It's an extra field to fill in therefore <strong>it takes extra time to complete sign up</strong>, so the more fields there are to complete the more <strong>I'll think twice about signing up</strong>.

<h4>But what if I misspell my password?</h4>

A password field will be starred out i.e. you don't see what you're typing, which means <strong>you could easily make a mistake and submit the wrong password</strong> without knowing.

This is where the '<strong>Forget your password</strong>' function comes in handy, which is an inconvenience but will have you up and running again with your old/new password in a couple of minutes.

<h4>Sign up forms with confirm password</h4>

<h4>What you think on Twitter</h4>
<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/leemunroe"><img src="http://twivatar.org/leemunroe/mini" /></a> What's everyones thoughts on confirm/verify password fields on sign up. Are they necessary?</blockquote>

<a href="http://twitter.com/djlowry"><img src="http://twivatar.org/djlowry/mini" /></a> I'd say if you have a FOOLPROOF password reset mechanism it's ok, but remember users are always the weak link.

<a href="http://twitter.com/webtwozero"><img src="http://twivatar.org/webtwozero/mini" /></a> yes! either that or do what neilsen suggests and make password fields plain text... :o

<a href="http://twitter.com/davymac"><img src="http://twivatar.org/davymac/mini" /></a> Confirm/Verify just a nuisance to me, I use 1Password or Textexpander to fill that in, so it just makes me paste twice

<a href="http://twitter.com/yanngraf"><img src="http://twivatar.org/yanngraf/mini" /></a> Unnecessary. The iphone Password system is good. You see the char you typed for 1 sec then it disappears

<a href="http://twitter.com/cgallagher"><img src="http://twivatar.org/cgallagher/mini" /></a> I despise them. Just make sure they have a means of getting back in if they do manage to mess it up :)

<a href="http://twitter.com/kylegawley"><img src="http://twivatar.org/kylegawley/mini" /></a> They don't bother me so much, handy for the odd times when a typo is entered into a password field during a rushed sign-up.

<a href="http://twitter.com/gdpwatson"><img src="http://twivatar.org/gdpwatson/mini" /></a> Yes. A large portion of support calls to clients regarding log in issues were reduced when we introduced a p/word confirm field.

<a href="http://twitter.com/arcainus"><img src="http://twivatar.org/arcainus/mini" /></a> i would think so, just incase you mistype it =)

<h4>To confirm or not to confirm?</h4>

<strong>What is the best route to take if designing/developing a sign up form?</strong> Have an extra field to verify the password or forget about the extra field and assume if the user makes a mistake they can use the forgotten password link? Or is there something else about the confirm password field that I'm overlooking here?
