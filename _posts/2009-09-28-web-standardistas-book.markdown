    Thanks so much for the review Lee, it's very much appreciated.

    David, our next book is 'Beginning HTML5 and CSS 3', again on friends of ED. It's currently scheduled for publication in April, 2010. However, this book builds right into that book, i.e. it should be read first to establish a solid, standards aware platform, before embarking on the HTML5 and CSS 3 shizzle majizzle.

    Everything in our first book is still 100% valid, HTML5 and CSS 3 build on standards aware web design and development. If you, or anyone else, are interested in getting a heads up on our new book (and contributing some ideas - elements that you'd like covered) please do get in touch:

    chris [at] webstandardistas [dot] com

    If anyone has read our first book we'd love to hear from you. We strive to ensure our teaching is not only inspiring, but accurate and your feedback is very much appreciated.

    Again Lee, thanks for the review.

  content: "I misread the part of your post: \"Before this I was using tables, unstructured
    markup and invalid HTML. Who do I have to thank for this? Chris Murphy and Nicklas
    Persson, two lecturers on the IMD course.\"\r\n\r\nIt implied (to me anyway!)
    that they taught you how to code badly with tables etc! It took me a few seconds
    to understand why you were recommending the book!"

  content: Ben, Lee's post might indeed be interpreted that way at first glance. I
    can assure you, however, that - short of breaking the rules (or any laws of the
    land) - we take a firm a line with any students that opt for tables all the way.
    (I'll leave you to interpret the words 'a firm line').

  content: Hi, i'm in the market looking for a book to guide me to build websites
    the "right way". Should I just wait for ‘Beginning HTML5 and CSS 3′ which is scheduled
    for publication in April, 2010? As far as my googling research tells me, both
    HTML5 and CSS3 is not slated for "official" launch anytime soon, so..? [Just a
    little background, i'm a "print" graphic designer precariously maintaining my
    company's website, using Dreamweaver and common sense, haha ....]

  content: "Thanks Chris. I actually bought your book 2 days after I read your above
    comment! haha... I'm now on page 262, fyi and so far so good. I like the way you
    don't \"hurry\" things, laying down the basic html \"abcs\" proper and building
    up at a noob-friendly pace with meaningful visual illustrations.\r\n\r\nOk, having
    said that, I do think I spotted a syntax typo on page 249, somewhere at the centre:\r\n
    \ ~~~ Shouldn't this be    ?\r\n\r\nI was googling for some sort errata of your
    book but couldn't find one.\r\nIt would be helpful if there is one, so I don't
    end up learning the wrong thing because of a typo! lol... thanks for reading.

Every so often I will receive an email that asks the following:

<blockquote><p>How can I learn how to build websites?</p></blockquote>

There are two approaches you can take to learning how to build websites.
<ol>
<li>Learn how to build websites</li>
<li>Learn <strong>how to build websites the right way</strong>, aka <em>the Web Standardistas' way</em></li>
</ol>
<!--more-->
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1430216069/leemunroe-21"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/book1.jpg" alt="Web Standardistas" title="Web Standardistas" width="201" height="240" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1590" /></a></div>

I built my first website over 10 years ago but it wasn't until final year of my University degree course Interactive Multimedia Design (IMD) that I discovered how to <strong>build sites properly using well structured HTML and CSS</strong>. Before this I was using tables, unstructured markup and invalid HTML. Who do I have to thank for this? <a href="http://mcmxc.org/">Chris Murphy</a> and <a href="http://takete.com/">Nicklas Persson</a>, two lecturers on the IMD course.

Now you don't have to take a University course to be taught by these two world renowned mentors. They have branded themselves as the <a href="http://twitter.com/standardistas">Standardistas</a> and have put all their years of wisdom and knowledge on paper in the form of <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/leemunroe-21/detail/1430216069">HTML and CSS Web Standards Solutions: A Web Standardistas' Approach</a>.

This book will teach you how to build websites from scratch. Starting with the basics of <strong>semantic markup and how web pages work moving onto styling your first web page with CSS</strong>. It's a one stop shop for putting together your first web site.

<h4>Who is it for?</h4>

<ul>
<li>People who want to learn how to build websites</li>
<li>Developers who need to brush up their front end markup skills</li>
<li>Designers who are using outdated techniques e.g. tables, to build websites</li>
<li>Professionals who want to earn the badge of a Web Standardista</li>
</ul>

<h4>Benefits of the Web Standardistas' approach</h4>

<ul>
<li>Separates content and presentation (easier to update layouts)</li>
<li>Reduced markup (reducing page download times)</li>
<li>Increased accessibility (for screen readers and other platforms)</li>
<li>Cross browser compatibility</li>
<li>Forward compatibility</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recommended</h4>
It's an easily read book, clearly laid out with lots of code examples to help you get started. After reading this you'll be able to build websites with your eyes closed.
