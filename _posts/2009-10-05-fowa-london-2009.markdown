Had a great time at FOWA London last week. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/RyanCarson">Ryan</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/joleeen">Jo</a> and the <a href="http://carsonified.com/">Carsonified team</a> for hosting another superb event.

Rather than listing everything that was talked about over the 2 day event I've put together some notes on things that stood out.

<!--more-->

<h4>280 Atlas</h4>

<a href="http://280atlas.com/">Atlas</a> is a development environment for building web/desktop apps with <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a>. Looks really easy to setup and should be available in November - check out the demo below.

<h4>PayPal Change How We Pay</h4>

<a href="https://www.paypal-changehowwepay.com/">PayPal</a> are opening up their platform. What does this mean? Check out the 'Anthem Video' below.

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.paypal-changehowwepay.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/paypal.jpg" alt="paypal.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="196" /></a></div>

<h4>Facebook Connect Wizard</h4>
Facebook now has an easier way for you to setup Facebook connect on your site. Check out <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/setup.php">Facebook Connect Wizard</a>.

<h4>HTML5</h4>
Bruce Lawson gave a great talk on HTML5. I'm definitely a lot more excited about it now.

Check out <a href="http://html5demos.com/">HTML5 Demos</a> for some cool examples (best viewed in <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>).

<h4>Go Test It</h4>
Go Test It is a useful tool for running website tests across various browsers. <a href="http://go-test.it/fowa">Sign up for a free trial</a>.

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://go-test.it/fowa"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/browsers.jpg" alt="browsers.jpg" border="0" width="517" height="135" /></a></div>

<h4>Other speaker notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Addison Berry - Make your app 'open', the more open it is the more you will have people contributing for free</li>
<li>Osama Bedier - Remove friction and enable innovation</li>
<li>Chris Abad - praise your passionate community, incentivise users to market for you, make use of viral channels (e.g. Twitter updates)</li>
<li>Robin Christopherson - 80% of Twitter is from mobile devices, captchas = 7% loss in conversions</li>
<li>Alex Hunter - Be emotionally invested in your brand and be willing to risk your reputation on your app</li>
<li>Lynne d Johnson - 35% of adults now have Facebook profiles</li>
<li>Dave McClure - Less = more, remove features, focus on UX, make fast iterations and measure goals</li>
</ul>

As far as I know the videos of each talk will be <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/2009/london/content">uploaded shortly</a>.

Met lots of great people at FOWA, all doing really interesting things. If there's an opportunity for you to attend a future FOWA, take it :)
