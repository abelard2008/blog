Smashing Magazine recently asked me to put together an article on the Irish web design industry, and I obliged.

The article contains some great interviews with some of Ireland's top designers, some info about what's happening across the island and a showcase of some top notch websites.

<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/23/showcase-of-web-design-in-ireland-2">Read the full article here.</a>

p.s. sorry if none of your sites are featured - don't take it personally, there are only so many I can fit in.

Submit your site to <a href="http://webdesignire.com/">WebDesignire</a> so I can feature it next time ;-)
