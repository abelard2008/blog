  content: "Website planners are amazing tools, vastly underestimated, but having
    them as an 'email checklist' for clients to fill in and get back to you is actually
    damaging your 'upsell' opportunities.\r\n\r\nI conduct a business review, and
    have done since I started sales, Its essentially a website planner but it is also
    aimed to draw out other sales opportunities, i.e print design, business stationary,
    advert design, email marketing and now guerella marketing services, that although
    the client only approached you with one sales querry, you can potentially (depending
    on your sales skills) walk away with a bigger contract."

    I guess it depends what services you offer (e.g. I try to stay away from print

    review for every enquiry?\r\n\r\n@Larry: Super, nice link http://astuteo.com/estimator/\r\n\r\n@Ted:
    No set examples (apart from the example used above). I tend to just save templates
    all the time if I notice I'm using them more than once. And they tend to change
    over time too with slight iterations\r\n\r\nThanks for all the comments. Some

    I’ve always been unsure what type of documents I should use and I do be afraid
    of bombarding my clients with them. \r\n\r\nWhenever I speak to a new client to
    talk about pricing they are always not happy to part with 50% of the price upfront.
    This really frustrates me but sometimes the job is interesting and I really want
    the new client. I end up dropping down to about 35%. Do you ever have this problem?
    (Perhaps if I become more established I will not have this problem)"

  content: "Lee, every enquiry gets a business review bar none [ too long in sales
    ;) ]. It doesn't matter if you are focusing purely on web development or doing
    everything under the sun, its about extracting the maximum sales potential from
    the client.\r\n\r\nFor example, a new client approaches you for a website you
    tell him it costs this much based on what they say they want, say for example
    its something simple like a static html site, no CMS, but because you haven't
    asked about future plans, 12 months later then come back needing e-commerce, ok
    its more work so more money, but by asking the question are you going to diversify
    into selling online shortly, you get the e-commerce sale now, rather than risking
    the sale going elsewhere in a year.\r\n\r\nAlso even if you don't do print design,
    say you know someone who does, you take the sale and subcontract to that person
    and the client is happier as they have one point of contact for all their design
    needs.\r\n\r\nThe business review is not only a sales aid but also a customer
    service tool that maximises your profit and increases the likelyhood of a sale."

  content: "@raphael: Depends - if you get 20 enquiries a day you need to filter it
    down somehow (especially if you're a freelancer as you can't spend all day on
    the phone, or if dealing with international clients). I think from a freelancers
    point of view, or certainly my point of view, I want to find out if it's a project
    or client that I'm interested in straight away - no pussy footing around. If they're
    serious about wanting you to work on their project, then they'll have no problem
    filling in the planner :)\r\n\r\n@Steve: Have never had a problem getting a client
    to sign a contract, but my contracts wouldn't be that serious. Basic outline of
    their responsibility (getting assets and feedback to you in timely manner), your
    responsibility (what you're delivering and in a timely manner) and payment plan.
    If they don't want to sign something like that, ask them what's stopping them
    and work with them to resolve the issue. If they still don't want to sign anything
    I'd be weary of them.\r\n\r\nI don't know how well my contracts would hold up
    in court - thankfully I've never had to find out. But a signed piece of paper
    still gives both sides ease of mind and you both know where you stand."

    \ It does come in handy getting the broad outline of a project together when you

    we did this back in 2005/2006 after seeing Happy Cog's project planner so credit

  content: Good resources Lee. I'm definitely liking The Invoice Machine, definitely
    seems like better features than Freshbooks, and cheaper to boot. Beats the standard
    Paypal invoicing. Andy's article on Contracts and the examples of Client Questionnaires
    from Happy Cog and Buffalo should come in handy too, as i'm lagging behind in
    the business paperwork department.

As a freelance web designer it makes sense to <strong>have a number of documents prepared</strong> as you tend to <strong>use the same ones over and over again</strong>. I thought I would share with you the 5 documents that I have prepared and ready to use, along with some excellent examples from other designers and studios.

<!--more-->

<h4>1. Website Planner</h4>

<div><a href="http://www.designbyfront.com/#contact"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/planner.jpg" alt="planner" title="planner" width="540" height="198" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1653" /></a></div>

The website planner is <strong>sent out to potential clients to gather their requirements</strong>. This gives you a quick overview of the project and helps you decide whether you want to take it on or not.

The goal is to find out:

<ol>
<li>Who the client is</li>
<li>What the client does</li>
<li>What the project is</li>
<li>What the client wants (deliverables)</li>
<li>An understanding of their market and competitors</li>
<li>What they like and don't like (about their current site and other sites)</li>
<li>Budget and time</li>
</ol>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.designbyfront.com/#contact">Front</a></li>
<li><a href="http://planner.builtbybuffalo.com/step-1/">Buffalo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://clearleft.com/canhelp/">Clearleft</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.happycog.com/contact/">Happy Cog</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Emails</h4>

I have <strong>several email templates that I save in a plain text file</strong>. This is to save me retyping the same emails over and over. Templates include:

<ul>
<li>For when you are interested in a project and attaching a website planner</li>
<li>For when you don't have time to take it on and have to decline it (and maybe recommend someone else)</li>
<li>Sending a proposal to a potential client</li>
</ul>

<h5>Example</h5>

<blockquote>Hi Bill,
 
Thanks for your email. I'm afraid I'm booked up with several projects at the moment so don't have time to take on the redesign of Microsoft.com

You might like to try Steve from Apple.com - another very good designer that I highly recommend.

Best of luck with your project </blockquote>


<h4>3. Contract/Proposal</h4>

<div><a href="http://24ways.org/2008/contract-killer"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/contract.jpg" alt="contract" title="contract" width="540" height="143" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1654" /></a></div>

Once you've gathered your clients requirements and have a good understanding of what they require, you need to<strong> send them a contract and proposal</strong>. Things this document should include:

<ol>
<li>Outlines both parties obligations</li>
<li>What you are going to produce and the deliverables</li>
<li>How much the project will cost</li>
<li>Payment plan e.g. 50% up front deposit, 50% on completion</li>
<li>Signatures from both parties</li>
</ol>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://24ways.org/2008/contract-killer">Andy Clarke has an excellent example of a killer contract</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/06/freelance-contracts-dos-and-donts/">Freelance contracts: do's and don'ts</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Services &amp; Pricing</h4>

<div><a href="http://haystack.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/services.jpg" alt="services" title="services" width="540" height="210" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1656" /></a></div>

I personally don't use this one (so I wouldn't call this essential) but it's useful to have. A document outlining your services and prices. This way you can <strong>send potential customers a list of what you do and also give them a ballpark figure for how your pricing works</strong>.

It's good to get this out of the way up front in case their budget doesn't suit your pricing.

<h5>Examples</h5>

<a href="http://haystack.com/">Haystack</a> shows rough pricing costs for studios.

<h4>5. Invoice</h4>

<div><a href="http://invoicemachine.com/home"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/invoice.jpg" alt="invoice" title="invoice" width="540" height="164" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1655" /></a></div>

An invoice template that you can send to clients requesting payment. <strong>I highly recommend you use some sort of invoicing system</strong>, there are lots to choose from.

Invoices should include:

<ol>
<li>Who the invoice is to (client)</li>
<li>Who the invoice is from (you)</li>
<li>Date and invoice number</li>
<li>Service(s) carried out</li>
<li>Total costs</li>
<li>Any terms e.g. Payment required on receipt of invoice</li>
<li>A little thank you note</li>
</ol>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ad0e9f5a75372-1">Freshbooks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.billingsapp.com/">Billings</a></li>
<li><a href="http://invoicemachine.com/home">The Invoice Machine</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.simplyinvoices.com/">Simply Invoices</a></li>
</ul>

Do you have any other documents at the ready? Please share with myself and others below.
