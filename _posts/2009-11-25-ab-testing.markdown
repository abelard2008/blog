  content: "Personally I only use A/B testing when I want to increase conversions
    on a site, because it gives you a very easy way to spot a winner. I'd also say
    that it's only really useful if your site has a reasonable amount of traffic.\r\n\r\nFor
    any experience testing, I think you need to really look at user testing because
    going by numbers on something such as experience is tricky unless you have a very
    clear set of goals you can compare against."

  content: "@Chris: That's a really good point Chris. I guess I consider the conversion
    part of the UX, or at least the result of a good UX, which had an impact on my
    choice of wording for this post's title. Be interesting to know if other designers
    consider conversions part of the UX? That said, of course user testing has a big
    hand in perfecting UX design, but wanted to highlight the awesome A/B tester that
    Google has in this post, for anyone who hasn't heard of it yet.\r\n\r\n@Lee: Nice
    plugin - good way to break in a new design too\r\nhttp://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-ab-theme-split-tests/"

  content: "@Lee Totally agree that conversation is part of the whole UX, but I guess
    I generally see conversation as leading to some kind of conversion metric but
    I guess that could easily be something like improving the amount of people who
    post a status update as well as increasing sign ups.\r\n\r\nUX is such a broad
    term, but there is definitely a need for A/B testing :)"

  content: I probably don't test things as much as I should, and I'd be the first
    to admit that. I'm mostly designing the visual interface and CSS stylesheets and
    then I pass things on to our developer to work with the nuts and bolts of the
    system. Interesting read though, and I can definitely see the advantage of doing
    so.

    about the next example: I have a blue "call to action" button for signing up on
    my rss, but how can I test this button (green version) if I can''t add javascript
    to the target page (which is the feedburner page)? Thanks!'

    It's very effective, I was about to go from 2% conversion to over 20% conversions
    using the methods over a 6 month period. Everyone should have some form of testing
    for websites.

As a web designer it's hard to get the user experience design right first time, <strong>you never know how users are going to use the site</strong> or how big a difference small iterations will make, so it's important to <strong>test the user experience and try out different solutions</strong>. That's where A/B testing comes in.

<!--more-->
<h4>A/B testing</h4>
A/B testing involves <strong>showing different users different versions of a site</strong> and <strong>measuring how each version performs</strong>.
<ul>
	<li>Design two (or more) versions</li>
	<li>Randomly show users different versions</li>
	<li>Track which version performs/converts better</li>
	<li>Evaluate</li>
	<li>Use the best version</li>
</ul>
Sounds complicated doesn't it? Thanks to Google it's not as hard as you think. Google has a <a href="http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer">Website Optimizer</a> service that enables you to easily setup A/B tests and then analyze the results for you.
<h4>A/B testing in action</h4>
I recently setup a very simple test with <a href="http://sharethrough.com">Sharethrough</a> changing the call to action text of two buttons and measuring conversion to the products page.
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Some users seen these buttonsâ€¦</td>
<td>and others seen these (50/50 split)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ab2.jpg" border="0" alt="ab2.jpg" width="250" height="80" /></div></td>
<td>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ab1.jpg" border="0" alt="ab1.jpg" width="250" height="80" /></div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong style="font-size:1.2em;">A </strong></td>
<td><strong style="font-size:1.2em;">B </strong><strong style="color:#bae682;font-size:1.2em;">5% improvement</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
Version B showed a 5% improvement on conversions to version A, the original.

I must stress <strong>this is a very simple test</strong> I put together but it just goes to show that even the smallest text change can make a difference. I can now go onto <strong>setup more tests and experiment with button placement, language used etc. while measuring conversions to enquiries and conversions to user signups</strong>.
