Every year I  take a look back at the past 12 months and set some goals for the year ahead. It's good to get it down on paper (or screen) and by making it public there's more chance of actually following through.

<!--more-->

<h4>A look at the 2009 list</h4>
This time last year I set myself some goals. <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/new-years-resolutions-for-2009/">Take a look at 2009's post.</a>

<strong>Run another marathon</strong>
Success: Ran the London Marathon although failed to beat last years time

<strong>Read more</strong>
Success: Have read a good few books this year and started listening to <a href="http://www.audible.co.uk/">audio books</a>

<strong>Bungee jump</strong>
Fail: Haven't seen any about and didn't try hard enough to find one

<strong>Learn to play the guitar</strong>
Fail: Haven't even touched it and it continues to gather dust

<strong>Go surfing</strong>
Success: Surfed in Santa Cruz over summer

<strong>Spend less time on the computer</strong>
Fail: Probably not

<strong>Blog more</strong>
Success: Blogged quite a bit and did a load of guest posts

<strong>Speak at an event</strong>
Success: Spoke at FOWD Belfast Tour and Barcamp Belfast

<strong>Launch a successful web application</strong>
Pending: Launched <a href="http://lookaly.com">Lookaly</a> (and a few other <a href="http://twitireland.com">side projects</a>) which has grown and formed a super community around it but still a bit to go

<strong>Do something for charity</strong>
Success: Thanks to <a href="http://sponsorlee.org">some really generous and supportive people</a> I raised over £2,000 for Action for Kids

<strong>Be an extra in a movie</strong>
Success: Was an extra in a Mo Mowlam movie starring Julie Walters (to be on channel 4 in 2010)

<strong>Climb Kilimanjaro</strong>
Fail: Never even got around to thinking about it

<strong>Secret resolution</strong>
Success: Got engaged to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leemunroe/4154422608/">Miss Suzy Smith</a>

Also managed to tick off another objective from 2008, which was live away from home for at least 1 month, which I did by staying in San Francisco over the summer.

<h4>Goals for 2010</h4>

<strong>1. Bungee jump</strong>
Find a bungee and jump

<strong>2. Be a yes man</strong>
Be more like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091896746?ie=UTF8&tag=10homepa-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0091896746">Danny Wallace</a> (or Jim Carrey) and say yes more

<strong>3. Learn something new</strong>
Take a class on something that doesn't include programming or designing

<strong>4. Go to an international (i.e. outside of UK/Ireland) conference</strong>
SXSW, Web 2.0, Le Web - something like that

<strong>5. Redesign this site</strong>
Getting a bit outdated now and could do with a fresh coat of paint

<strong>6. Launch/design an iPhone app</strong>
iPhone app design/dev is something I've still to look into

<strong>7. Review at least 1 book per month</strong>
Hopefully this will encourage me to read more and take notes while doing so

<strong>8. Work with some really cool clients</strong>
Fortunately I already do work with some really <a href="http://leemunroe.com/portfolio">cool clients</a> and I want to find and work with more who are working on exciting things

<h4>What are your goals?</h4>
There isn't really anything too serious or extreme in there, everything is very doable.

<strong><em>What are your plans for 2010 and what did you accomplish in 2009?</em></strong>

Happy new year!
