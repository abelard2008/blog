  content: "I got it for christmas and I'm on the second chapter at the minute. The
    first chapter was great but finding the second a little too basic but the rest
    of it looks great.\r\nI prefer having everything in a book rather than lots of
    different articles spread around on the site, make it much easier to read I think.\r\nAnd
    I agree about the binding, really awkward turing the pages without breaking the
    spine."

  content: "My binding has already broke!  Page 89 is out and stuck back in with tape!\r\n\r\nI
    am currently on chapter 4 and so far I'm really enjoying the book.  I have to
    agree with Johnathan tho, I like having all the material in my hand than it been
    spread across many pages of a website.\r\n\r\nA lot or should I say 90% of what
    I've read so far I knew or was at least aware off but it is nice to have a refresh
    of things now and again.  Looking forward to finishing the book too."

    my paypal account). but I have summarized some of this book a few followers on
    twitter and more and more I blame myself for not buying it. something I do not
    like is that it published for free in pdf as it is not the same as having him
    in the hand. as you say Lee should be a Bliblia wall for web designers

    produced for the book. You will not find any of the content on the Smashing Magazine
    website except the pre-released sample chapter.

Starting off with my <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/new-year-resolutions-2010/">first book review of the year</a>.

I was very excited to hear about a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Magazine</a> (SM) book, entitled 'The Smashing Book'. SM is undoubtedly the number one web designer's resource on the web. Whenever I need to find something, it's the first place I go to look. It covers all aspects of web design and has some great authors who put a lot of effort into their writing.

<blockquote>The book contains no lists of links or aggregated content. It has 10 carefully prepared, written and edited stories that are based upon topic suggestions and wishes of Smashing Magazine's readers.</blockquote>

<h4>Who is it for?</h4>
Web designers. Most definitely for beginners. Intermediate to seasoned designers should know most of the book but it's a nice reminder of various best practices.

<h4>What's in it?</h4>

As you'd expect, the book covers pretty much all aspects of web design.

<ol>
<li>User interface design</li>
<li>CSS layouts</li>
<li>Typography</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Color</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
<li>Increasing conversions</li>
<li>Turning a website into a remarkable brand</li>
</ol>

On top of these in depth chapters there are interviews with some of the industrie's well established designers.

<h4>Verdict</h4>

The book is basically all of SM's best articles condensed into a book. This is what you'd expect, as it would be hard to top what they have on the website already.

The content is very detailed, perhaps even too much in some cases, but <strong>it is like a 'bible of web design'</strong> covering all the things you should know.

<strong>Not a big fan of the book's aesthetics</strong>  - it's a bit like a novel in size and has an <strong>awkward bound</strong>. Would have liked to see a bigger, more open book (take <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/leemunroe-21/detail/0321658531">Handcrafted CSS</a> or <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/leemunroe-21/detail/1430216069">HTML and CSS Web Standards Solutions</a> for example).

If you're an avid reader of SM like I am, then you've probably already read most of the book before. Nice read to refresh your memory and I enjoyed the extra chapter about SM behind the scenes. <strong>I'm glad I have the book but if you're strapped for cash, most of it <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">is all available online</a>, for free.</strong>
