  content: i agree, website designer seems to be all encompassing, but i think the
    terms has got very weird connotations as if 'oh my 15 year old nephews's a webdesigner...',
    i think in more industry circles it's good to just elaborate a little or say all
    three

    have started with \"Web Designer\" but recently been telling people \"Web Developer\"

    I'm a "Web Developer". Although strictly I'm a Software Engineer and I also do
    design for websites the bit I'm best at is developing stuff on the web. Hence
    "Web Developer".

  content: I find it hard to nail down exactly what I do as being strictly "Web Design",
    because I do design for print too, and love designing logos. So I would say I'm
    a "Web &amp; Graphic Designer". To anyone that works in the industry I'd just
    say "Designer", but that's a bit ambiguous to some folks!

    \r\n\r\nMuch like your description above, I do it all. I design interfaces, I
    code, I do front-end, I do back-end. I create imagery/graphics, I sometimes even
    do logo work. It varies. \r\n\r\nSome people consider all of this Web Design,
    others break them down into separate niches. Perhaps Web Extraordinaire would

    of work you're after.\r\n\r\nAs a freelancer, if you like designing for small
    businesses e.g. a restaurant, then they're more likely to be looking for a \"web
    designer\" when they come across your website.\r\n\r\nA web startup developing
    a new app on the other hand may be specifically looking for an \"interface designer\".\r\n\r\nSo
    it's worth keeping in mind the type of client you're after."

    owner as well as a designer,  I definitely see the need to tweak my response depending
    on who I am speaking with. Like many of us, I design for print as well as web,
    and I do front-end development and logo and branding work as well. So one title
    doesn't cut it in all situations. I like Web Designer or Visual Designer, but
    I have clients who really like call me their Web Master. So I go with that when
    it suits the situation. Thanks for the discussion, its nice to read how others
    grapple with this too. I like a lot of suggestions.

    design, web design, fashion design, packaging desing, ux design, ...).\r\n\r\nBut
    of course I think 'graphic design' involves so many different subjects, so you
    have to get specialized in something (print and web design in my personal situation).\r\n\r\nI
    also specialize in search engine optimization, but I don't put that into 'graphic
    design' of course.\r\n\r\nPrint design, web design, fashion design, packaging
    design, ux design, ... all of those are creative works for sure where you have
    to apply some design skills and passion to get your work done.\r\n\r\nYou can
    call yourself whatever you want as far as you are loving what you are doing. That's

There are a lot of different titles associated with being a web designer. Lately I've been thinking about what exactly my job title is, so <strong>when someone asks me "What do you do?" I reply with my "official" answer</strong>.

<!--more-->

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/nerd.png" alt="nerd.png" border="0" width="540" height="200" /></div>

<h4>Web designer</h4>

For a long time now I've been saying "web designer". There used to be a time when people would have been like "huh?" but nowadays most people understand that to be <strong>something to do with making websites</strong>.

But I think this term can be a bit loose. <strong>And everybody seems to be a web designer so wouldn't it be "cool" to be something different?</strong>

<h4>User experience designer</h4>

I like the sound of user experience designer. I put a lot of thought into the <strong>usability of websites</strong> I design and focus on an <strong>enjoyable experience</strong> so this title sums that up.

However, I also do <strong>front-end development</strong> (CSS/HTML/Javascript) and I want to make sure this is clear. 

Also, if I tell someone outside of our industry that's what I do, they'll likely ask <strong>"A user experience designer for what exactly?"</strong>, which is kind of a usability defeat in itself.

<h4>Front-end web developer</h4>

This makes it clear that <strong>I code websites</strong>, specifically the front-end stuff, but it's not clear if I do the designing or not.

<h4>Interface designer</h4>

An interface designer implies that I <strong>design interfaces</strong>, most likely <strong>focusing on user experience and interaction</strong>. 

But it doesn't say what I design interfaces for. Websites? Software? Mobile phones?

<h4>Depends who you're talking to</h4>

It does very much depend who you are talking to. <strong>If my granny asks</strong> me what I do, for example, I'm just going to say <del>"I make websites"</del> <strong>"I work with computers"</strong>. But if I'm <strong>at a web conference, I'll be more specific</strong>.

<h4>Shouldn't all web designers do these things?</h4>

Shouldn't a good web designer be automatically assumed to be a...
<ul>
<li>User experience designer</li>
<li>Front end developer</li>
<li>Interface designer</li>
</ul>

...for the web? In my opinion, <strong>yes</strong>. Or you should at least know a good bit about each, whether it is your primary role in a large company or not.
