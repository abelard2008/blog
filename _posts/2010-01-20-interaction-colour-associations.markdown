  content: "For my dissertation I had to include a colour scheme for rating risks
    on a 5 point scale.  I used the same scheme the UK government uses for its terror
    threats scale - and it meant that at a glance managers could differentiate between
    severe risks and low risks without having to analyse numerical data e.g comparing
    green to red instead of 1 to 5.\r\n\r\nIn my experience it proves extremely valuable
    from a usability point of view"

  content: "Should colours be used on a web site for actions? Surely this would be
    an accessibility issue as it would lose its meaning for colour blind people. Obviously
    if the button etc has a text equivalent this is most likely not an issue.\r\n\r\nI
    think a lot of people claim web accessibility on their web sites but do not think
    what accessibility really means.\r\n\r\nFood for thought.. :-)"

  content: good point mike - i should have mentioned that my icons were coloured,
    but each had a unique symbol on it (warning triangle, exclamation mark etc) as
    well as a colour, and on roll-over a text description of what that icon meant.

    if the potential overuse of this would have worse effects than not using this

    as some have said, is not enough on its own. What about associating shapes (I
    guess icons are doing this to an extent) to actions as well as colour?\r\n\r\nThere
    are also cultural things to consider. Red means danger in some places and not
    in others, so if you're website covers an international market that is something
    to think about."

    with text. I think I read somewhere that roughly 8% of people were colour blind
    (don't quote me) so always worth keeping that in mind.\r\n\r\n@Chris: Very interesting.
    I wonder is there a place in the world that red means go and green means stop?"

  content: "I'm with Mike on his point about using colour and the implications for
    accessibility, but I think that we could argue that this is a progressive enhancement
    to be enjoyed by the roughly 92% (don't quote Lee on this) non colour blind people.
    \r\n\r\nThe inclusion of colour, assuming the paradigm is valid in the users cultural
    rulebook, certainly adds a useful visual reference with probably an element of
    subconscious recognition. Providing it is combined with words and icons then my
    view is that it is a useful addition to any interface."

  content: "For true accessibility, you must consider those that are colour blind.
    This means that you cannot rely on colour alone. Associate an icon with an action
    and only then colour it. \r\n\r\nAlso of note: I have seen electric light switches
    in North America where an LED on the switch is Green when the switch is off, and
    Red when it's on. This seems to be backwards until you think about it. When the
    light is off, pressing the button marked with a green LED turns it on. When the
    light is on, pressing the button with a red LED turns it off. Makes sense when
    you think it through that way. The LED indicates what will happen when you press
    the switch. Not what the status of the switch is."

  content: "I agree with you, definitely. \r\n\r\nThe issues I've been having with
    color in interface design are with color schemes that don't support the usual
    red, yellow and green, ie. Orange, blue and grey. \r\n\r\nIn that case, do you
    think it would help to have local associations? Maybe a bright blue would be a
    good action, a dark orange would be a bad one?\r\n\r\nMy point being, is it really
    the colors that are associated or is it the relative values of the colors that
    can give an element an inferred action?"

    web related, Cream Soda. I am originally from South Africa. Green is *the* Cream
    Soda colour... obviously! But in the UK, the only Cream Soda available has no
    colour. (I just can not drink it.) The other day I had a chat with an Australian
    that was talking about Cream Soda. So I asked her what is the colour. She said
    red! Red to me is strawberry flavour. \r\n\r\nThe same goes for Walkers crisps,
    which to me is wrong btw. Blue is suppose to be Salt and Vinegar and green should
    be Cheese and Onion. \r\n\r\nTo me it is what I got use to. And somehow I can
    not change that. But colour associations change to different parts of the world.
    A bit tricky I would say."

Different colours mean different things to us and by using colour we can associate feelings and actions to certain situations.

<!--more-->

<h4>A short story about a safe</h4>

Recently I was staying in a hotel and like most hotels it had a safe in the room. <strong>To activate the safe I had to dial in a pin number of my choice and press the lock button.</strong>

I put my valuables into the safe, <strong>keyed in a 4-digit number and hit the big green button</strong>. But it didn't lock. Instead it cleared the pin I entered.

I then read what the buttons said and <strong>the green button actually said 'Clear' and red said 'Lock'</strong>.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/safe.jpg" alt="safe.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="347" /></div>

<h4>Colour association</h4>

We associate colours with various actions in our everyday life. <strong>Green tends to stand for good, and red for bad.</strong> On a traffic light, for example, green means go and red means stop.

In the case of the safe above, I expected to type in a number and hit the green button to indicate that I was good to go. <strong>I based this decision on other interactions in everyday life</strong>, for example, <strong>taking money out of an ATM</strong> where I would enter a 4 digit pin and hit the green button. I did this automatically, without even reading what the buttons said.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/atm.jpg" alt="atm.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="405" /></div>

I don't think there's either of us at fault here, we just interpreted the colour in different ways. <strong>The safe manufacturer probably assumed red means secure, where as I thought it meant error and green meant confirm.</strong>

<h4>Applying colour to web interaction</h4>

We can use this technique in our designs too, assigning different colours to different actions.

<strong>Using red for delete or cancel actions</strong> may make it quicker for your user to make an association with that link. Likewise, <strong>green can be associated with an add or save action.</strong>

Lets look at <a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> for example. Here are the actions associated with someone requesting to be connected to me.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/linked1.gif" alt="linked1.gif" border="0" width="245" height="141" /></div>

But what if we gave these actions some colour association.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/linked2.gif" alt="linked2.gif" border="0" width="245" height="141" /></div>

To me this <strong>cuts down the amount of time a user has to spend reading the action text</strong>. Instead, they are able to visually identify the green link and assume by clicking it will be a confirm action.

<strong><em>What are your thoughts on associating colours with actions and have you any good examples?</em></strong>
