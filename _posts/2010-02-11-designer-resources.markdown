  content: "As well as Campaign Monitor, there's also Mail Chimp. It's free, has a
    really beautiful interface, and it's tracks your campaigns as well.\r\n\r\nAnother
    resource I use almost daily is Colour Lovers - whenever I need ideas or inspiration
    for color schemes, or I just want to mess around and see what looks good together,
    I use that site. Sometimes creating the color palettes is addicting. :)"

There are a number of websites that you, as a web designer, will use on a daily basis <strong>making life easier and making you more efficient</strong>. 

Here is a list of 10 websites (in no particular order) that I find useful and am constantly using. <strong>I'm also interested in what websites you swear by and use all the time</strong>, so please share in the comments below.

<!--more-->

<h4>1. <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com">iStockphoto</a></h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/hbkmunroe"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/istock.jpg" alt="istock.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="359" /></a></div>

iStockphoto is a collection of <strong>royalty free photos</strong>, illustrations, video and audio. You can search for these resources based on any keyword and purchase <strong>from only $1</strong>.

<strong>iStockphoto saves you time and money</strong>. Need a good photo for a website but don't have the resources to setup your own photography shoot? iStockphoto will do the job, and you'll be able to use the photos legally as they're royalty free.

I find it really useful for <strong>illustration graphics</strong>. There are graphics available for $10 that could otherwise take you a day or two to design from scratch.

<h4>2. <a href="http://instantdomainsearch.com/">Instant Domain Search</a></h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://instantdomainsearch.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ids.jpg" alt="ids.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="263" /></a></div>

Checks the <strong>availability of domain names</strong> using Ajax.

Very handy when you have a brain wave and need to check if the domain name is available.

<h4>3. <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a></h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/sm.jpg" alt="sm.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="334" /></a></div>

Smashing Magazine is the <strong>ultimate web design blog</strong>.

If you need to know how to do something, or need some inspiration, Smashing Magazine will undoubtedly have an article on it somewhere. All you need to do is search the site.

<h4>4. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a></h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/stack.jpg" alt="stack.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="403" /></a></div>

A <strong>question and answer site</strong> for programmers.

The great thing about Stack Overflow as opposed to other forums is there is <strong>no sign up required</strong>. And it has a great community around it that are always willing to help.

<h4>5. <a href="http://www.seomoz.org">SEOmoz</a></h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.seomoz.org"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/seo.jpg" alt="seo.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="415" /></a></div>

SEOmoz is one of the best <strong>search engine optimisation related websites</strong> on the net.
