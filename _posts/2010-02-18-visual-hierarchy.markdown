  content: Awesome tip Lee. I usually squint my eyes, but the older I get the less
    effort I have to make to see things blurry. I don't know why I hadn't thought
    of this myselfâ€”probably because I'm getting old!

  content: Great tip - this was recommended by Cameron Moll at dConstruct a couple
    of years ago. another suggestion of his as well as blurring was to grayscale the
    image as well as blur it to really focus the visual hierarchy

  content: "Actually, it shouldn't be completely grayscale. The human eye can still
    see a limited amount of colors when scanning. \r\nThe way I mimick it is:\r\n1.
    copy the colored layer\r\n2. desaturate the copied color layer. (which is on top
    of the colored original)\r\n3. put the desaturated layer on 75% opacity (so 25%
    of the colored layer gets trough).\r\n4. copy paste the total effect &amp; play
    with the blur.\r\n\r\nI never make a screenshot of it however. I play with the
    blur (gaussian), starting from 25px to 5px ... \r\nIt's important to see the big
    area's first, then focus on them &amp; reduce the blur to see the elements which
    then pop out. Also you should only blur the viewport, doing the full webpage will
    give you totally different results !"

  content: Instantly recognize the hierarchy? Wow, it that even possible? Maybe we
    should reexamine why we seem to think a user will leave if not instantly interested.
    Trust me, if a user is looking for something they will most likely stay until
    they find it. I'd be willing to bet that if you ask ten different people what
    the hierarchy is for a particular website you'll get ten different answers. In
    the end it's all about content; that's what keeps people interested.

    dude

When a user visits your website, <strong>you have 5 seconds to grab their attention</strong>. Okay, maybe that's not always true but none the less <strong>you want to make sure there's a banana</strong> (banana being the key element you want your users to look at) <strong>to grab their attention</strong>.

You also want to make sure that visually <strong>your website has a hierarchy</strong> and is broken down <strong>in order of 'importance'</strong>. <strong>Call to actions, H1s and H2s</strong> will fall under the more important elements, then H3s, H4s and links, then paragraph text and other images towards the bottom of the scale.

A user should be able to look at a page and <strong>instantly recognise this hierarchy</strong>. Now here's a useful way to check if your hierarchy is as clear as you hope it is.

<!--more-->

<h4>Blur your vision</h4>

Usually after designing a website I'll use this technique to check for visual hierarchy. <strong>Look at the website and blur your vision.</strong> Yep, sounds a bit weird, but what you're trying to see is if the <strong>elements you want to stand out still stand out</strong>.

<h4>Blur your screenshot</h4>

So that your eyes don't get sore and to give you a bit more time to analyse it, <strong>take a screenshot</strong> of your website, bring it into <strong>Photoshop</strong> and give it a <strong>Gaussian Blur</strong> (Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur) of <strong>5px</strong>.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/picture-5.png" alt="picture-5" title="picture-5" width="327" height="328" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1820" /></div>

Here are the results.

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://basecamphq.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/37.jpg" alt="37.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="600" /></a></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://boagworld.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/boag.jpg" alt="boag.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="600" /></a></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://futureofwebdesign.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/fowd2.jpg" alt="fowd.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="600" /></a></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ux.jpg" alt="ux.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="600" /></a></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://clearleft.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/clearleft.jpg" alt="clearleft.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="600" /></a></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wufoo.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/wufoo.jpg" alt="wufoo.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="536" /></a></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://google.com"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/google1.jpg" alt="google.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="405" /></a></div>

<h4>Does it work?</h4> 

If you find you need to improve the visual hierarchy for different elements you can alter the following.

<ul>
<li>Size</li>
<li>Contrast</li>
<li>Colour</li>
<li>Shape</li>
<li>Position</li>
<li>Whitespace and padding</li>
</ul>

You could go one better and <strong>blur the screenshot by 10 pixels</strong> to see if your 'banana' still sticks out.

<strong><em>What do you think, does it work? Does it help?</em></strong>
