  content: "One other thing, I couldn't decide on a logo so ended up using plain text
    and hiding it until rollover.\r\n\r\nThis goes against basic usability principals
    as it requires an interaction for the user to know whose site they are on but
    thought I would experiment with it. If you think it's pants just say ;-)"

  content: Looks really nice. Just one thing, now that you're using CSS3, I would
    add some css transitions to the hovers, it's a good plus (although only for webkit
    users).

  content: "It's the risk factor I'm loving about this! And it's the wee details like
    that rollover covering your name that will intrigue people when they land on a
    website, assuming they are fairly familiar with intuitive interfaces of course.
    At the same time though... I would be keen to see what logo you come up with,
    if you do decide to use one here.\r\n\r\nA designers website is like an open into
    what they're all about, or at least it should be, so I always enjoy getting a
    peak at the way other designers do their personal sites.\r\n\r\nI like the way
    you have the homepage header colour changing for each time the user lands on the
    page. How many colours do you have in rotation there? And what way did you do
    that?"

  content: Much prefare this design to the old one. Much more user focused and will
    function very well on iphone, ipad and other touch screen devices. This is something
    I have considered alot when re-designing my new site.

A quick blog post this week as I've been working on getting a new portfolio/blog on the go. This was one of my goals for the year and shouldn't have been too hard since I started working on it back before Christmas, but it did take a bit longer than expected.

<!--more-->

<h4>Old site</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/old1.jpg" alt="old.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="414" /></div>

<h4>New site</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/new.jpg" alt="new.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="405" /></div>

I wanted a minimal, light-weight site that was more blog focused, while also experimenting with some CSS3 niceness.

I'll follow up next week with a few notes on design decisions and techniques I've used.

Feel free to let me know what you think.
