  content: Only thing I'm not sure about is the use of HTML5 doctype while not using
    HTML5 tags like . If it's not going to be fully HTML5, is there a good reason
    to not stick to earlier doctypes? Or on the flip, if it's doctype HTML5, why not
    use those elements?

  content: "Since you’re using the HTML5 doctype, why aren’t you omitting the <code>type</code>
    attribute on <code>link</code> and <code>script</code> elements?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    why use a separate print stylesheet (rather than simply using a media query in
    <code>style.css</code>)?\r\n\r\nWhat’s the point of something like <code>&lt;div
    id=&quot;main&quot; class=&quot;main&quot;&gt;</code>? In most cases, it seems
    to me you won’t need that much markup at all. Why include it in your website framework
    if it’s only needed like 0.01% of the time?\r\n\r\nIn <code>script.js</code>,
    why not use <code>$(function() { });</code> instead of <code>$(document).ready(function()
    { });</code>? It’s shorter, easier to remember and does exactly the same."

  content: "Lovely clean framework structure there, Lee. I looked through your site
    code before and remarked how well structured your CSS is in particular. \r\n\r\nI
    know (shamefully) I don't write my CSS as organised as I should, because it's
    usually just going to be me looking through it to find things. Probably similar
    logic to 'my bedroom isn't a mess because I know where everything is'! :-) But
    I am going to start to use a proper framework though to make my life easier writing
    stuff, and yours is probably one of the neatest I've read, with Yaili being the
    only other of the same level of tidiness!\r\n\r\nOne main thing I see you do quite
    different is that you write your CSS on single lines - I find that harder to read,
    so that's probably the only adjustment I'd make to that stylesheet framework,
    but other than that it's perfect for moi!"

  content: "Thanks for the comments. Some good points about the HTML5 doctype.\r\n\r\nThe
    HTML5 doctype is a lot simpler, requires less code and allows you to get away
    with more stuff (e.g. not closing img tags).\r\n\r\nHaven't used HTML5 elements
    because I know they're not all supported in all browsers, or require a JS hack,
    so playing it safe for now.\r\n\r\n@Mathias: Thanks for the heads up on the 'type'
    - you're right, these can be removed (force of habit).Didn't know about the JS
    trick either. Reason I have both a class and id of main is that I will apply the
    ID of main to wherever the main content is (for the skipto link) which might not
    always be a div with a class of main"

  content: Nice writeup!  I always like to see how others organize their sites.  I
    typically have in my root directory a folder called assets, which has folders
    js, css, and images within that.  Normally, the images I place in the images folder
    are either connected via css or the site layout.  I'll have another folder in
    the root for uploaded images, etc.  Also, I might have a folder in the root named
    phplib, which has all of my classes, settings, etc.  Just another way to do it...

  content: Although the way others choose to layout their directory structure will
    inevitably differ from yours, the principle of having a framework blueprint prepared
    will save time and frustrations later on. Like you say, not every project can
    have the same structure, but having a familiar framework to build on and maintain
    will save you valuable time and ultimately money. Great article!

  content: You should put all of your styles into a 'css' folder. It only makes sense
    considering images and javascript files have their own folders. In your stylesheet,
    you've numbered sections in the contents, but when you arrive at those sections
    there are no numbers. You should actually include the numbers as they are in your
    navigation i.e. 6. tables. It would be easier to search for 6. to instantly take
    you to that part of the stylesheet.

    HTML5 elements such as , ,  et al but with such \"hacks\", IMHO, like HTML5Shiv
    and IE-CSS3 providing support for HTML5/CSS3 goodies among all browsers do you
    not have the urge to test run them and make life easier writing clearer markup

    consistent. I update it as I go and make changes when I find I'm using something
    fairly often. Looks like it might be time for an update since HTML5 is gaining
    some traction. We'll see...

    rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress Dummy Content Plugin</a> I can populate a test blog

    no-repeat;}\r\n#logo a{display:block;height:100%;width:100%;}\r\n#logo a span{position:absolute;left:-9999px;top:-9999px;}\r\n\r\nI
    assume this is to hide the anchor text so only the image shows. If this is the
    case, you can save some markup and css with the following:\r\n\r\n#logo a{overflow:hidden;
    text-indent:-9999px;}\r\n\r\nThe above will move the text out of the container,
    and the overflow:hidden; will ensure there is no bug issues in IE. Thus, you can
    save some CSS, and not need to use a span every time you want to \"hide\" text."

  content: "Hi Lee. A good article.\n\nI do something very similar to your set up.\n\nI
    guess I'm slightly anal when it comes to folder structure. I like every file to
    have it's place.\n\nIn the root of the project the structure would look something
    like this:\n\n/a/\nindex.html\n/folderA/index.html\n/folderB/index.html \n/folderC/index.html\n\netc.\n\nThe
    directory /a/ is where I store all my 'assets' hence the name 'a'. I don't name
    this directory 'assests' because there may well be a directory within the site
    that alphabetically could appear above 'a'. Therefore by naming it 'a' it will
    always be at the top of the root level meaning I will always know where I can
    scroll to to access my assets rather than searching in amongst directory names.\n\nWithin
    here the /a/ directory the structure would look like this:\n\n/a/css/screen.css
    - global screen styles\n/a/css/print.css - print styles\n/a/img/global/ - global
    images\n/a/img/common/ - images which are common within different sections of
    the site\n/a/img/folderA/ - images for folderA (folderA is an example name for
    a section)\n/a/img/folderB/ - images for folderB (folderA is an example name for
    a section)\n/a/img/folderC/ - images for folderC (folderA is an example name for
    a section)\n/a/js/global/scripts - global JS scripts (jQuery & jQuery library
    files)\n/a/js/common/scripts - common JS scripts\n/a/swf/ - Flash files (again
    could have section specific directories)\n/a/dld/ - downloads\n/a/dld/pdf/ - PDFs\n/a/dld/doc/
    - Word Docs\n/a/dld/vid/ - Quicktime videos\n\nI'm sure you'll see a pattern with
    either 2 or 3 letter naming convention for the directories.\n\nI've been using
    this approach over the last 5+ years and I find that it works great form me. Very
    efficient and easily viewable when looking through a large site with many directories."

You've done your research, sketched out the wireframes, designed a stunning mockup and now its time to markup. Where do you start?

Having your own reusable framework is a great way to <strong>save time and provide a basis for your next website</strong>.

Your own reusable framework is by no means perfect for every project that you work on but it is a <strong>great starting point</strong> and it can <strong>evolve</strong> over time.

<!--more-->

This post looks at the current framework I have in place and breaks it down. <strong><em>Please feel free to reuse this as you see fit and also point out anything that you feel would be beneficial to add (or remove).</em></strong>

<h4>Framework structure</h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture-3.png" alt="Picture 3.png" border="0" width="382" height="182" /></div>

All files are kept in a folder simply named '<strong>NewSite</strong>' which contains the following:

<strong>ie.css</strong >
A stylesheet specific for <strong>IE6</strong> (or sometimes 7) that at the end of a project will usually contain various <strong>CSS bug fixes</strong> and PNG transparency fixes.

<strong>images/ directory</strong>
For storing all images for the website.

<strong>index.html</strong>
The <strong>main template</strong> for the website. Depending on CMS or programming language I use this will be chopped up at some stage.

<strong>print.css</strong>
A stylesheet used when printing a document.

<strong>scripts/ directory</strong>
For placing all the project's Javascript files.

<strong>script.js</strong>
A default script for placing most of the project's Javascript code, stored in the scripts directory.

<strong>style.css</strong>
The main stylesheet.

Now lets look at what each file contains.

<h4>index.html</h4>

This is the main template for any website and the starting point for marking up.

<pre><code>
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<meta name="description" content="">
	<meta name="keywords" content="">
	
	<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
	
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" media="screen" />
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="print.css" media="print" />
	
	<!--[if lt IE 7]>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="ie.css" type="text/css" />
	<![endif]-->
	
<!-- 	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"></script> -->
	<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/script.js"></script>
	
	<title></title>
</head>

<body>

<p id="skipto"><a href="#main">Skip to content</a></p>

<div id="header" class="group">
	<div id="logo"><a href="/"><span></span></a></div>
	<ul id="nav">
		<li class="selected"><a href=""></a></li>
		<li><a href=""></a></li>
		<li><a href=""></a></li>
		<li><a href=""></a></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div id="content" class="group">
	<div id="main" class="main">
	
	</div>
	
	<div class="sidebar">
	
	</div>
</div>

<div id="footer">
<p>Copyright &copy;</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
</code></pre>

Notes about the markup used:

<ul>
<li>The doctype is <strong>HTML 5</strong></li>
<li>There is a '<strong>skip to content</strong>' link for screen readers (the style sheet will hide this)</li>
<li>Uses a conditional statement to load <strong>ie.css for Internet Explorer browsers below version 7</strong></li>
<li>JQuery library is included using <strong>Google's CDN</strong> (but is commented out until it is needed)</li>
<li>The bare bones of the markup has been added</li>
</ul>

<h4>styles.css</h4>

Now lets look at the default stylesheet I'm using.

<pre><code>

.clear{clear:both;}
.alignleft{text-align: left;}
.alignright{text-align: right;}
.aligncenter{text-align: center;}
</code></pre>

Notes for the stylesheet:

<ul>
<li><strong>Author name</strong> at the top. I'll also include the <strong>project name and date</strong> here. This is mainly for the records of anyone the site is handed over to.</li>
<li>Using <strong>comments</strong> to break down the stylesheet into <strong>sections</strong> making it easier to scan down and find styles. Larger projects may have a different structure.</li>
<li>A general <strong>reset</strong> for margins and padding. There are lots of more advanced resets out there but I find this basic one works well. <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Read about CSS reset here</a></li>
<li>.group:after - the group class is applied to <strong>any element that needs cleared right after</strong>. Usually where there are 2 or more floats side by side.</li>
</ul>

<h4>ie.css</h4>

<pre><code>
.group {zoom: 1;}
</code></pre>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>As it stands, only contains a fix for the .group class</li>
</ul>

<h4>print.css</h4>

<pre><code>
#header, #footer{display:none;}
</code></pre>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>Removes the header and the footer when printing. The final file will need tinkering with though.</li> 
</ul>

<h4>script.js</h4>

<pre><code>
/*
$(document).ready(function() {
	
});
*/
</code></pre>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>The document ready function is for JQuery Javascript functions that you want to run when your page loads. This is commented out until needed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/NewSite.zip" class="button cta"  onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/downloads/framework'); ">Download framework as zip file</a>

Please feel free to use these templates in your own projects.

Again, this is just a framework I've put together over time. I recommend you adapt it to suit your own environment.
