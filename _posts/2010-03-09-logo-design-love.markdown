  content: This book is actually on my Amazon wishlist at the minute and have a note
    in my Things app to remind me to buy this (for when I know I'll have the time
    to read it). Will buy it very soon though! I never buy books, but I want to buy
    this one because I know I will benefit from reading it. When I do get around to
    reading it I will blog my own review of what I thought of it, as a logo enthusiast
    and a usually-finds-it-hard-to-read-books type person! :-)

  content: Added to the ol' Amazon wishlist! Graphic design is something that has
    only been on my radar in so far as those elements that apply to web design. However
    being a closet artist I've always had a love of all sorts of art forms. I see
    this as a great stepping stone towards getting to grips with graphic design. Thanks
    for the heads up Lee.

What excited me about <a href="http://www.logodesignlovebook.com/">Logo Design Love</a> was that it was written by fellow Northern Irish man <a href="http://twitter.com/davidairey">David Airey</a>.

David, responsible for the popular <a href="http://www.logodesignlove.com/">Logo Design Love blog</a> as well as his own <a href="http://www.davidairey.com/">personal blog</a>, is a brand identity designer who has worked with top brands globally.

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321660765?ie=UTF8&tag=leemunroe-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0321660765"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/47161595.jpg" alt="47161595.JPG" border="0" width="185" height="238" /></a></div>

<blockquote>When you finish reading this book, you hopefully will be well-prepared to go out and win your own clients and create your own iconic brand identities.</blockquote>

<h4>Who is it for?</h4>
The book is primarily for <strong>graphic designers</strong>. As David shares his experience of being a designer it would be mainly for <strong>beginner/intermediate</strong> range, but a good read for all.

There are a lot of things shared about dealing with clients and being self employed so <strong>I would recommend this to any creatives who freelance or deal with clients</strong>.

<h4>What's in it?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Lots of great examples of <strong>brand identities</strong> (and how the designers got to the finished product)</li>
<li>Step by step advice on designing the perfect logo for your brand</li>
<li>Dealing with <strong>clients</strong></li>
<li><strong>Project managing</strong> a logo design project</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> your service as a designer</li>
<li>From <strong>pencil</strong> to PDF</li>
<li>Experience from a <strong>self employed</strong> graphic designer</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verdict</h4>

<strong>Very inspiring book.</strong> I haven't done any logo design in a while, after deciding to focus more on web stuff, but now <strong>I can't wait to get stuck into a logo project</strong>, even if it is just for myself. <strong>The book is full of inspiration and ideas.</strong>

Also something that you get out of the book is <strong>tips on dealing with your clients and being a freelancer</strong>. David shares a wealth of knowledge, a lot of which I can relate to and a lot of which I can take advice from. <strong>If you're new to freelancing, whether you're a graphic designer, illustrator, web designer or developer, you will be able to learn from this.</strong>

<strong>Very glad I bought this book.</strong>
 
<h4>Pull quotes</h4>

<blockquote>The average American sees 16,000 advertisements, logos, and labels in a day</blockquote>

<blockquote>What you take away is just as important as what you keep</blockquote>

<blockquote>People often choose products based on their perceived value rather than their actual value</blockquote>

<blockquote>Color really is secondary to the shape and form of your design</blockquote>

<blockquote>Designers who advertise a list of predetermined prices for x amount of concepts with x rounds of revisions are attempting to commoditize a profession that by definition cannot be commoditized.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Paula Scher, "It took me a few seconds to draw it, but it took me 34 years to learn how to draw it in a few seconds."</blockquote>

<blockquote>always give the client an estimate that is longer than the amount of time you're guessing it will take</blockquote>

Some sound advice!
