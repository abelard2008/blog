    Didn't Matthew finish his speech outside :O Joking there, obviously.
    Great to read this, every time I read a "diary" about someone's day at a "convention" or something alike it sounds fantastic. I am definitely going to attend one in the future.

First day over at SXSW and a new day is upon us. Here's a quick recap of the first day.

<!--more-->


<h4>Beauty in web design</h4>
By <a href="http://www.cennydd.co.uk/">Cennydd Bowles</a>, Clearleft

The talk focused on created masterpieces in web design. To date we haven't really had any - not to the measure of other masterpieces such as the IBM logo, London Tube Map or the intro credits to Se7en.

<h5>Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>We're kinder to attractive people</li>
<li>Beauty makes things easier to use - our brains respond differently to aesthetically pleasing objects</li>
<li>3 types of beauty - universal sociacultural and subjective</li>
<li>3 modes of design - visceral, behavioural and reflective</li>
<li>How to get to your masterpiece - get emotional, think bigger, lead, thing long term, broaden horizons, be brave.
</ul>

<h4>Get stoked on web typography</h4>
By <a href="http://badassideas.com/">Samantha Warren</a>

Samantha's talk was about using beautiful typography on websites, pushing the boundaries and not just settling for Georgia or Arial. Very inspiring and some great examples used throughout her presentation.

<h5>Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>It's not about what font you use, it's how you use it</li>
<li>Get stoked = be completely and intensely enthusiastic about type</li>
<li>Find the emotion of your site and based the type choice around that</li>
<li>Start to experiment with modern web type solutions: Cufon, @Font-Face, TypeKit, FontDeck</li>
<li>Start to endorse CSS3 and make use of text-shadow, multiple columns and rotation</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yourfonts.com/">Create your own font</a> for $10</li>
<li>Or <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/">create a more professional font</a> (for a lot more)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Simple steps to great web design</h4>
By <a href="http://squaredeye.com/">Matthew Smith</a>, Squared Eye

Unfortunately the fire alarm went off half way through Matthew's talk and we had to evacuate, which is a real shame as he was building up to something great. But the basis of his talk was about how it's not just about creating a lovely looking website

<h5>Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Design around the content</li>
<li><strong>Great</strong> web design helps content get stuff done - on the web <strong>with pleasure</strong></li>
<li>Know your audience</li>
<li>Know your content</li>
<li>It's all about knowing the core of what you're designing for</li>
</ul>

So far so good for SXSW. Roll on Day 2.
