Day 2 and things are getting a lot busier, which means the talks are crammed but there's more people to meet.

<h4>10 Commandments of UX</h4>
By <a href="http://www.nickfinck.com/">Nick Finck</a> and <a href="http://rainavancleave.com/">Raina Van Cleave</a>.

Great talk about UX and what it means.

<h5>Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>UX is a focus</li>
<li>The core elements are represented by the <a href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000029.php">honeycomb diagram</a></li>
<li>The user is always right</li>
<li>Visualise your user - what do they do, what do they look like, what do they wear?</li>
<li>Find the user's sweet spot, which is a cross between your objectives, technology requirements and the user needs</li>
<li>95% of users aren't reading 80% of your content - this makes your content even more important</li>
<li>Access to your site is for everyone, not just your core users (all ages, all cultures, all devices)</li>
<li>Think about the 1 thing users should be able to do and focus on that</li>
<li>Learn from failure - Einstein, Jordan, Walt Disney all failed but got back up</li>
</ul>

<h4>CSS3 design with HTML5</h4>
Panel

An intro into CSS3 and HTML5.

<h5>Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have to look the same in every browser</li>
<li>There are HTML5 and CSS3 techniques you can use today</li>
<li>Educate IE6 customers - if need be use the "it'll cost more to make sure it looks the same on IE6" technique</li>
<li>HTML5 doctype is very simple - once you declare it you're 'buzz word' compliant</li>
<li>When using the new HTML5 elements use the IE Javascript fix (<a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/">like this one</a>)</li>
</ul>

Awesome day and loads of parties to finish the day off.

I've setup a <a href="http://leemunroe.posterous.com/">posterous blog for various SXSW tidbits</a> if you want to follow it too.
