The big brands are also here like Google, Microsoft etc.

There's a 3D Panasonic TV on display and its absolutely amazing. Like looking through a window rather than at a TV. <em>Apparently</em> these are going to be the next big thing and will be in homes within the month.

Would be great to see some Northern Ireland companies here this time next year.
