  content: "&gt; Be careful when emulating Amazon features – you need the traffic
    first\r\n\r\nVery true. A good example of this is sites that have little/no traffic
    and create a forum - then wonder why nobody is posting.\r\n\r\n&gt; Phase in new
    design features – target non-cookie users first, then x amount of users, then
    open up to all\r\n\r\nThat's an interesting idea."

    Hey Lee,

    SXSW was pretty cool, wasn't it? I wish I met you there. I've been following your blog for a while now and I would have loved to chat a little bit. I met Andy Budd, Paul Boag and a few others. Maybe next time I'll get to meet you, too. :-)

SXSW continues to be a great experience. The talks are good but the best and most valuable part of the whole experience is meeting and talking to people. People I admire as a designer, people I admire as an entrepreneur, potential clients, existing clients and just people that are working on damn good stuff. It's an inspiration.

Some notes on what I attended today:

<h4>Social Search: A little help from my friends</h4>
Panel
<h5>Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Users want personalised responses to questions</li>
<li>Give something good to customers to talk about and they'll start the conversation</li>
<li>Social search is about providing the user with information on what's going on right now</li>
<li>Make it personalised and relevant - relate to friends, relate to location</li>
<li><a href="http://vark.com/">Aardvark</a> - ask a question and it'll find you the answer</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oneriot.com/">OneRiot</a> - realtime search</li>
</ul>



<h4>Revealing design treasures from the Amazon</h4>
By <a href="http://www.uie.com/">Jared Spool</a>
Really interesting insight into Amazon and how people use it.
<h5>Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Website owners often think "Why don't we do it like Amazon?"</li>
<li>Alarm clocks aren't going to get good reviews</li>
<li>1/5 of all orders are heavily influenced by reviews</li>
<li>The "Was this review helpful" question is worth $2.7bn to Amazon</li>
<li>Be careful when emulating Amazon features - you need the traffic first</li>
<li>Phase in new design features - target non-cookie users first, then x amount of users, then open up to all</li>
<li>Eliminate tool time - shorten steps, remove obstacles</li>
<li>Don't fear trying new ideas</li>
</ul>

<h4>@anywhere</h4>
Evan Williams, CEO of Twitter, introduced us to <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/03/anywhere.html">@anywhere</a> - a new framework for integrating Twitter features into your website.

Product looks interesting, similar to Facebook Connect. The talk/interview itself was a bit underwhelming. No good take-aways, just chatting about Twitter.

Jonathan Cusick is also writing <a href="http://www.jonathancusick.co.uk/">some good blog posts</a> on the Northern Ireland gang too. Worth a read.
