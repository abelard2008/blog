    where well behaved haha. It's fantastic that we had a strong contingent representing
    the NI web community. I'll just have to make sure I'm apart of it next year.

<a href="http://sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> was a truly amazing experience. The biggest event I've ever been to. With a huge exhibition centre and a couple of streets closed off in Austin for the festivities it would be hard not to be.

If you're thinking of attending next year, here's an overview.

<!--more-->

<h4>Talks</h4>
There are so many talks to choose from and so many good topics on at the same time. <strong>Choose wisely</strong>, as there are times when you'll go to a talk and it turns out it might not be what you thought it was about.

<h4>Exhibitions</h4>
There is lots to see and do in the exhibition hall. Various companies are there with stands promoting their brand with a tonne of <strong>freebies</strong> from pins to tees to discounts. And obviously beer is the main winner (which gets a huge crowd around your stand).

As a spectator this is a good chance to <strong>get talking to the guys who run these companies</strong>, as they'll listen to you as long as they can sell you their product as well. You might pick up a few leads here.

<h4>People</h4>
The people in Austin were very friendly. You could walk up and talk to anyone. Seems that everyone in the creative industry was there. People I have a lot of admiration for like Jeffrey Zeldman, Tim Van Damme, Jason Santa Maria, Wilson Miner and Ryan Sims. Or people that I don't specifically know of but have admired their work. It's inspiring to meet these guys who are working on some world class stuff.

<h4>Parties</h4>
It really is a full week of partying. But you're not just out partying with your mates,<strong> you're partying with some of the most intelligent and creative people in the world</strong> who work for some of the most innovative and biggest companies in the world so it's a <strong>great time to get a chat with them</strong>, introduce yourself and tell them what you do over a beer.

<h4>Northern Ireland crew</h4>
It was good to get to know all the <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/sxsw-2010/">companies and people that attended from Northern Ireland</a>.

A big thank you is due to <a href="http://www.investni.com/">Invest NI</a> for funding the trip, and the team that was out, in particular <a href="http://twitter.com/TradeandExport">Terry Reilly</a>, and also <a href="http://twitter.com/cimota">Matt Johnston</a> from the <a href="http://digitalcircle.ning.com/">Digital Circle</a>.

As far as I can tell everyone had a good time and came back feeling <strong>inspired</strong>, <strong>invigorated</strong> with new ideas and with a pack of <strong>new business leads</strong> and contacts.

I would definitely recommend the trip to all next year and also <strong>keep an eye out for more supported trips this year including WWDC and Web 2.0</strong>

<h4>A few tips about The States</h4>
For those of you who aren't from there:
<ul>
<li>It's customary to tip 15%-20% of the bill for pretty much everything - even for bad service</li>
<li>Tax is added to the retail price at the til - so don't bother working out if you have the exact change to pay for that bottle of water</li>
<li>The streets are laid out in blocks, as a grid system - it's a lot easier for getting around</li>
<li>Americans are very friendly people - at least the people I was chatting to :)</li>
<li>They drive on the right side of the road - just like everyone else in the world</li>
<li>Restaurants always offer you free refills - and free water</li>
</ul>

<strong><em>See you next year?</em></strong>
