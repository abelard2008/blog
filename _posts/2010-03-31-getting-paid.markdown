  content: Fantastic post Lee.  I've been messed about more than a few times with
    freelance, simply down to a lack of any formal contract.  Good information.

  content: "I wouldn't even want to scare you with some of the stories I could tell
    you about projects that went sour that I've been involved in. None of these were
    a personal expense to me, but in a small agency and when a project is worth a
    good few grand it's not good!\r\n\r\nOne recent project (inside the past month
    or so), which had been ongoing for several months previous... I designed an interface
    for an online electronics store. These guys <strong>believed</strong> they could
    rival amazon. These guys were determined to get this shop developed. They were
    advised that selling wouldn't be easy, and that it's not just as simple as throwing
    a shop up and watching the products fly out the door. Once I designed it, our
    Developer built it.\r\n\r\nThese guys refused to continue making payments for
    the work commissioned because they are convinced there is something wrong with
    the website, and that is why it's not selling (ignoring everything they were told
    by us about the potential problems they may face in the global market place).
    *bang head off brick wall scenario! :-)"

  content: "Nice post, issues that every freelancer faces.\r\n\r\nI charge less as
    a deposit (25%), but you're definitely right that a deposit is vital. Makes your
    client take your time seriously, and on a purely business basis also has a positive
    impact on cashflow.\r\n\r\nI don't ask for payment on receipt of invoice. I behave
    like any other business, with a 30 day billing period. That I'm a freelancer who
    might need the money is neither here nor there. I've found that often clients
    will pay quickly (or even immediately), particularly if it's a smaller scale project
    for a new business (when they're all excited).\r\n\r\nSomething you didn't mention,
    which I've found works quite well, is including both early payment bonuses and
    late payment penalties. e.g. While I have a 30 day payment period, I sometimes
    offer 2% discount if paid within 7 days, or a 1% discount if paid in 14 days.
    The slight reduction in price is easily balanced by a quick and positive cashflow."

  content: "Some nice tips there Lee!\r\n\r\nI've only ever had one client not pay
    me until 2 months after the website went live, but by that time I had took the
    website down and put a message on the landing page for the domain. I had tried
    both ringing and emailing with no response...Phone always rang out! The client
    eventually sent me a cheque with a note telling me they didn't know how to transfer
    money from a UK bank account into an Irish bank account... Lame excuse I know!
    \ I've refused to carry out any more work for the client since.\r\n\r\nI ask for
    a 33% deposit up front with additional 33% payment at halfway and then the final
    payment when finished. This seems to work well for me and my finances. My last
    6 clients have actually paid me the final payment 1-2 days before the project
    was finished which is always nice!\r\n\r\n\r\nRobin Cannon:  \r\n\r\nNice tip
    there mate! Offering a discount in-order to get the payment quicker is something
    I might look into!"

  content: "Great advice there Lee. I have to admit, getting a contract in place and
    a deposit are two things  I'm sloppy with, yet they are probably two of the most
    impressive measures a freelancer could take. Gets the designer and client in a
    serious mode without one taking the mick out of the other.\r\n\r\nHave to point
    out too, @Robin Cannon, great advice. A real incentive to getting paid by adopting
    an early bonus or late penalty scheme. I bet that gets clients eager to pay up
    asap!"

  content: Sweet post, very timely for me.  One think I noticed when billing clients
    is that, at least in the USA it seems, 'payment due on receipt of invoice' means
    pay whenever you want, but if I say pay within 5 business days, then I tend to
    get paid more quickly.  Five days seems like a long time, but it will fly by,
    and on the morning of day four, a friendly e-mail seems to help nudge along a
    forgetful client.

    I require a 50% deposit and payments upon delivery of milestones during the project.

    receipts. When tax time come, send it all to your tax preparer. To do a collection,
    documents are dated for easy forensic descriptions to the judge. BTW, alway ask
    for a return receipt when sent to a client through email.

    and so for I never had to ask for money as I was not doing any freelance work.
    This month I started doing some Fiverr gigs and, from there, some people started
    asking me for other jobs. For really small jobs I think I will stick to Paypal
    for now. There is a fee, but if you compare it to using just Fiverr, it is a lot
    better (they take $1 for every $5, and then you also lose money from Paypal fees)...

  content: "Thanks for the article, Lee! It was very helpful! I am a freelancer like
    many others posting here. My biggest problem it seems is being paid once the job
    is complete. It seems clients tend to think less of our jobs as developers/designers
    and put it to the side as something not so important or a job which isn't a legitimate
    way to make money, but more or less a hobby someone does for fun!  This is the
    attitude I've run into when trying to work with clients.\r\n\r\nAny tips for how
    to deal with this type of attitude?\r\nThanks!"

  content: "Great article on a really important topic.  Partly in answer to Lee G.
    above -- My standard method of operation includes most of the points raised in
    the article: Contract (proposal cover letter), Scope Document, Terms and Conditions
    and Schedule with payment milestones, etc.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally though, I build
    the site on my own subdomain and give the client access as the site is progressing.
    Once the client is completely satisfied with the site, they make final payment
    (generally something like 1/3rd) and I deploy to their hosting service. In other
    words -- I'm not done until they are satisfied - but they don't take control of
    the site until they have paid. Conceptually, this is like paying for something
    in a store. You pay and then the product is slid across the counter to you --
    or you pay for a car and then you get to drive it away. \r\n\r\nClients seem to
    understand and accept this method. The only challenge is when you are building
    sites with CMS - say a site build on Wordpress for example. The deployment step
    is a bit more complex -- extra work. In this case, you have to decide how much
    you trust the client, and whether it is worth the savings in time/work to build
    the site on their domain / hosting server in the first place. \r\n\r\nJust reemphasizing
    something else already discussed. I cannot over-emphasize the benefit of having
    a detailed scope and schedule to control scope creep and ensure that the client
    keeps up with their end of the bargain. The schedule MUST specify the client's
    responsibilities as well as yours. \r\n\r\nLast point - to Mark McCorkell's comment:
    Have a clause in your Terms and Conditions which makes it clear that you are not
    responsible for business results ! You ARE responsible that the website works
    correctly and according to the scope outlined. That all bugs are fixed, etc. But
    business results ? Give me a break ! That's like saying I won't pay for a cash
    register because folks don't buy what's in my store :)\r\n\r\nI would love to
    hear how others do this."

As a freelancer, or small business owner, it's extremely <strong>important to get paid as soon as possible</strong> because more than likely you don't have a Scrooge McDuck money bin to help you out. Money can be a tricky subject, and for one reason or another getting paid on time is something that will always crop up, no matter who you work with.

As a freelancer <strong>I've come across these obstacles myself</strong> and would like to share with you how I operate, and maybe you can share your own experience in return.

<!--more-->

<h4>Communication is key</h4>

Right from the start, communication with your client is key to making sure everything runs smoothly.

<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a <strong>contract</strong> (signed by both parties) with a breakdown of <strong>how much and when</strong> each payment is to be made.</li>
<li>Always<strong> be up-front with pricing</strong>. Let your client know how much something will cost before you actually do it, even maintenance work for existing clients.</li>
<li>If contracting on hourly/daily basis, <strong>keep track of what you worked on that day</strong>. You never know when you might need it as back up.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Always get a deposit</h4>

<strong>You haven't got a sale until money has exchanged hands</strong>. Once money is exchanged, both parties will take the project more seriously, and are now devoted.

Being self-employed you'll struggle to wait until to end of a project to get paid, as in the mean time you have bills to pay and a life to live. Getting paid in stages and asking for an up-front deposit should be no problem to any genuine client.

I will usually ask for either a <strong>50% or a 33% up-front deposit</strong>, depending on the size of the project. If 33% then there will be a second payment due mid-way through the project.

<h4>Payment on receipt of invoice</h4>

Generally in the world of business, you will usually have 30 days to pay an invoice. Some businesses might even allow 90 days, depending on how much money is involved. But again, being self-employed, <strong>30 days is a long time to wait for the money you've been working so hard for</strong>.

<strong>I ask for payment on receipt of invoice i.e. right away</strong>. And in my mind I hope to receive the money within 2 weeks. Of course that's not always the case.

<h4>Send reminders</h4>

<strong>Even good clients will forget</strong>; they have other things to do, other bills to pay and like everyone they will forget. 

If after 2 weeks you have not heard from them or have not received payment, <strong>send a friendly reminder</strong>. And be sure to <strong>re-attach the invoice for convenience</strong>. If after 3 weeks you have received nothing, <strong>send another reminder and perhaps follow up with a phone call</strong>. If it gets to over 1 month with no payment, this is when you start to worry.

<h4>Method of payment</h4>

Again, be sure to include your preferred method of payment in your contract so there are no surprises.

<h5>PayPal</h5>
The beauty of PayPal is that it's <strong>handy</strong>, and it's <strong>instant</strong> (unless sending an eCheck). Also, a lot of online invoicing systems already integrate with PayPal, again upping the handiness factor.

The problem with PayPal is that <strong>they take a cut</strong>. A cut of between 3.5% and 4%. So <strong>if you're getting paid £1,000, it'll cost you roughly £40</strong> getting paid with PayPal.

I tend to use PayPal for <strong>smaller amounts from remote clients</strong>.

<h5>Cheque</h5>
The good thing about a cheque is it <strong>won't cost you</strong> anything (except maybe 20p for lodging into a business account).

However, if you're getting paid internationally this can cause a problem as <strong>it can take forever to lodge your money (even up to 60 days as I once learned after receiving a cheque in U.S. Dollars)</strong>. You also have to wait that little bit longer for it to arrive in the post, and you have to make the extra effort to go down to your local bank (all this time adds up).

I usually accept <strong>cheques from local clients</strong>.

<h5>Bank transfer</h5>
For me bank transfer is the best method of payment. I pass on my bank details to a client and they do a transfer. Usually takes 1 or 2 days, depending on local/international transfer. If your client has online banking it <em>should</em> be handy for them to make the payment also.

A bank transfer <strong>will usually cost for both sending and receiving</strong>. The cost varies from bank to bank, and depends on local or international payments, although I've found it pretty reasonable (e.g. it will cost me £6 to receive a transfer from an American bank).

Bank transfer is the typical method I use for <strong>larger amounts from remote clients</strong>.

<h4>Accounting</h4>

When I first started freelancing, <strong>I setup a business account separate from my personal account</strong>. I find this a very useful way for organising and keeping track of money, as I don't really think of the business account as 'my' money.

Whenever payment comes in, I <strong>transfer two thirds of that payment into my personal account</strong> (both accounts are at the same bank so this doesn't cost anything). <strong>I keep one third in the business account to cover tax, national insurance and business expenses.</strong>

<h4>When things go wrong</h4>

If you're unable to get paid, the last resort is some sort of <strong>legal action</strong>. Thankfully I am inexperienced in this area. To date I've been able to get paid with no major problems. <strong>If you work with good people and use the tips above, hopefully you can avoid this too.</strong>

<strong><em>I'm sure there are some people out there with horror stories so please share and let us know how you dealt with the problem.</em></strong>
