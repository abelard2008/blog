I setup Tweet NI as a side project in 2009 to help people find others using Twitter in Northern Ireland. At the time Twitter was still emerging and very much had the early adopters on board so it was quite useful finding out who else out there was using the service.

Anyone on Twitter and from Northern Ireland can add themselves to the directory. It's quite useful if you want to find people in your area or certain types of people e.g. if you're looking for a journalist on Twitter from Northern Ireland just search for '<a href="http://tweetni.com/people?utf8=%E2%9C%93&keyword=journalist">journalist</a>'

Since then the #tweetni hashtag has been well adopted by many local tweeps, and as a result the website now aggregates all mentions of the #tweetni hashtag.
