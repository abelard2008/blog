  content: Hello, nice article, very intriguing. I think that if you use the * sign
    you should add a legend, because this is what most of the people expect in general,
    not only on the web. If you read an ad, for example, and you encounter a * you
    tend to look for the tiny line on the bottom explaining the meaning of the *.
    On the other side, you can choose to avoid the * and use words like "required"
    (like you do!) or "optional" (like others do). I think all choices can be good
    as soon as the meaning is clear :)

  content: I am a big believer in removing optional fields altogether from initial
    signups and leaving them for later. This way you maximise conversion and the user
    can complete other optional fields at their leisure. Not everyone has time to
    fill in their favourite pet or weekend hobby so why include it for everyone on
    day 1?

  content: It is an interesting question. Personally Its difficult for me to understand
    that there are people out there that don't know that a * indicates a required
    field. Help out the rest of us, don't include a legend and then the masses (well
    those who don't know about the required field *) will learn how to fill out forms
    through trial and error..lets face it, they will probably be fairly used to getting
    things wrong and having to retype things a few times anyway.. eventually resulting
    in no need to add the legend ever again. Get rid :)

  content: "I always assumed that the majority (if not all!) web users knew that the
    asterisk (*) indicated a required field. Until in a recent project we didn't provide
    a legend. In our feedback forum we actually recieved a comment complaning that
    there was no indication what the * symbols on our registration form meant - this
    is from a user who given their job position should be generally used to filling
    in web forms and know what the (*) symbol means! So I think some kind of legend
    should be used just be safe!\r\n\r\nI do like the Yahoo (optional) approach, but
    I think this would only generally work well in short forms."

    granted. I present my contact for like <b>Name: (required)</b>  and <b>Email:
    (required)</b> and that should be concise enough to let users know what they do/don't
    need to fill out.\r\n\r\nI find it interesting watching how my mum uses the internet,
    and my dad, because you get some insight into how non-tech minded people experience
    things - it's actually a good way to test things! \r\n\r\nPutting something as
    simple as (required) at the end of a field can prevent them seeing a validation
    error message. It really does depend on your particular users though, like you
    said... but better safe than sorry, eh? :P"

  content: I think your use of the term legend is confusing considering the legend
    tag which should be used for AA compliance with forms. Personally I'd say that
    the asterisk info is an instruction and is necessary. Additionally I'd recommend
    using an image of an asterisk with alt text such as "required field" as some screen
    reader users have their software set to ignore asterisks.

  content: "I've always been big on accessibility, so I'd most likely be inclined
    to add a legend, and one that is marked up as such. An asterisk on a form is a
    very visual thing. You can see at a glance that some fields have it and others
    don't. This asks the question what's different about these fields. \r\nSomeone
    using a screen reader might hear \"First Name Asterisk\". If they don't have a
    legend, and a legend that is read to the user before they come across the required
    fields (read: LinkedIn fail) then this is likely to confuse.\r\nI like the idea
    of not having optional fields at all and leaving the user to fill in optional
    information at their leisure, but just looking at this comment form, there are
    plenty of places where that just doesn't work."

  content: very interesting read.  I feel it really depends on the form and what you
    are trying to accomplish.  Take this comment form for instance.  It is common
    knowledge that if you want to leave a comment you need your name and email.  So
    I feel there is necessarily a reason to put the asterisk showing this.  Though
    I also don't think it hurts to put it in there either.  Guess it's really just
    who you are and what you prefer.

    A '*' could mean many things:

    - Required field
    - Must be 6 characters long
    - Must be 18 or over
    - Only on weekdays

    Sure, in the context of the question, it can probably be worked out, but why make the visitor do more brain work than is necessary? As Steve Krug would say, "Don't make me think!". Make life for the visitor as easy as possible. If that means putting a legend in tehn I think one should do so - it's not like it's much effort after all!

    though need a re-think. It is a real hassle to have to enter in the same information
    over and over again on different sites. Maybe some kind of site that would allow
    you to create one master template of your typically required details (similar
    to the way that http://www.gravatar.com works with your email address.). Then
    the rest of the details the form requires auto fill into the appropriate fields.
    This would need to be secure however, if things like credit card details were
    going to be held, so not sure how exactly that would work."

    using a key/legend.\r\n\r\nHowever, after reading through your comments I think
    the best solution is highlighting optional fields with the word 'optional' or
    required fields with 'required', which makes things less cluttered and also makes

    I'd like a change to how designers usually lay out forms. Instead of throwing

    the second below as optional. Or, give them a check-box asking them if they'd
    like to fill out optional data now or later, so they don't even need to see it
    until they want to."

    any sense. An asterisk does not mean a field is required, it simply means that
    there is a footer note. Using asterisks as instructions on their own changes their
    meaning.\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking about something I had experimented with before.
    Perhaps the correct use of the asterisk would be to set it as an anchor pointing
    to the corresponding footnote as you would if you were using footnotes within
    a Word documents. The link text could remain as an asterisk but then a title tag
    could be added stating that it is a required field."

    a usability engineer), though, is that "optional" tends to get overlooked.  Part
    of that depends on treatment, of course.  And I've seen it above, below, at the
    end, and after the label (like the one in this blog).  I'v also seen it in smaller
    font, in a different color, and in parens.  Interestingly, what I have never heard
    is anyone complain about too many asterisks (which is why, I assume, people use
    "optional").

  content: Most screen readers with the default verbosity settings will not read out
    the asterisk so the user won't know what's required whether you have a legend
    or not.  Either make every field required and indicate so at the top of the form
    or include the actual word 'required' after each field, or your form will be inaccessible
    to screen readers.
---
When you're designing a form most of <strong>you will mark required fields with an asterisk (<strong>*</strong>)</strong>. Then you'll add something like "<strong>*</strong> Required fields" to the top of the form. But surely we now live in a world where everyone already knows this. <strong>Do we really need to include a legend indicating what the asterisk means?</strong>

<!--more-->

<h4>Do we need to explain what it means?</h4>

A legend is a key that <strong>tells the user what certain symbols or words mean</strong> (I'm not talking about the &lt;legend&gt; element here). In most cases a form legend will look something like so:

<strong>* Required field</strong>

When you design a website there is typically at least one type of form (contact) and possibly many others (sign up, checkout etc.). Sometimes I do include a legend and sometimes I don't - but do we need to?

<h4>What do the big boys do?</h4>

<h5>eBay</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ebay.jpg" alt="ebay.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="439" /></div>

eBay indicates their required fields with <strong>*</strong> and includes a legend at the top "<strong>*</strong> Indicates required field".

<h5>Yahoo</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/yahoo.jpg" alt="yahoo.jpg" border="0" width="523" height="328" /></div>

Yahoo puts "<strong>(Optional)</strong>" beside the only field on their sign up form that is optional (out of 18 fields). This means<strong> the form doesn't get cluttered with asterisks</strong>. Good thinking as the label speaks for itself.

<h5>LinkedIn</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/linked.jpg" alt="linked.jpg" border="0" width="494" height="326" /></div>

LinkedIn interestingly has a legend at the bottom (<strong>below</strong> the submit button) indicating what <strong>*</strong> means, even though all fields are required.

<h5>BBC</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/bbc.jpg" alt="bbc.jpg" border="0" width="463" height="520" /></div>

The BBC complaint form marks required fields with <strong>*</strong> and includes a legend at the top.

<h4>Required fields only</h4>

Now you could argue the point that <strong>only required information should be asked for</strong> on forms. I'm a firm believer in the <strong>least amount of fields possible</strong>, and particularly for sign up forms this is true. Although for contact forms or checkout forms there will always be information that is optional e.g. web address, address line 2 etc.


<h4>It depends</h4>

I made the decision not to include a legend on <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/contact/">my own contact page</a>. My thoughts here are that:
<ol>
<li>Most people using my site will know what the asterisk means</li>
<li>If someone really doesn't know what it means, they're probably not the type of person I want to work with anyway</li>
</ol>

Depending on who your website is aimed at, <strong>you may or may not have to include a legend</strong>. New users or older generation users may not know what the asterisk means, so <strong>make the decision based on your target user</strong>.

<h4>Over to you</h4>

This is a very small thing and probably something as web designers we take for granted, but it can make a big difference as generally it involves your conversion page (signups, enquiries) so <strong>you don't want to lose any users</strong>.

Similarly to my blog post about <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/confirm-passwords-signup/">signup forms requiring confirmation passwords</a>, <strong>I'm interested in your perspective on this</strong>.

<strong><em>Do you still need to explain what an asterisk means on a form? Do you use some other method of indicating required fields?</em></strong>
