  content: Don't use that much paper to be honest as I like to present print outs
    to clients for approval. I use Free Mind, a free PC mind mapping app. Usually
    I print out a diagram and discuss with the client. Next I draw up a sitemap in
    inDesign. The reason I do this is that everything ends up in a PDF document for
    the client and it's easy gust to do it there and then. Wireframes are created
    in iPlotz, you can drag and drop common website elements to your page. It also
    has limited prototyping ability, nice exporting and file sharing. Suppose it would
    be better to sketch each stage before hand.

  content: "Great article lee, I use my mindmapping app for brainstorming, a great
    app called Ommwriter which is still a beta and mac only for writing content in
    and adobe fireworks cs4 for my wireframing. Starts with simple boxes for main
    elements then as the design grows it then has text, images etc added really easily
    from photoshop or illustrator.\r\n\r\nI agree with you tho with regards the pad,
    I generally only use one myself now if I get a bit of creative block and venture
    away from my desk with my ipod &amp; a4 pad to clear my head &amp; sketch ideas
    before transferring them to the computer again. I stopped using paper for my wireframes
    about 6 months ago when my son developed the knack of getting to my desk and using
    any pens / paper I left lying around to draw me pictures, quite a few contracts/wireframes/proposals
    got the mini blue tube design angle added at short notice."

  content: "Interesting that you should post this, because I was just quietly pondering
    to myself today what other people use for Wireframing!\r\n\r\nI actually use A4
    Whitelines paper, which is like an inverse of graph paper, it is a very faint
    grey, with white lines/squares. The advantage of using it is that it will help
    you draw, but the lines disappear when you scan the page in then. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/markmccorkell/4444849719/in/set-72157623650639362/\"
    title=\"Whitelines paper on Flickr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Example on Flickr</a>\r\n\r\nI
    would use it for mind-mapping and pretty much everything. I scribble lots of notes
    too on the wireframes so they aren't the most tidy - but they do help me, which
    I guess is the whole point.\r\n\r\nThere people that don't appreciate this part
    of the process, but when you try and work without it you can run into waste a
    lot of time in Fireworks/Photoshop. I'm no illustrator, but using the paper to
    figure out basic compositions really does help speed things up when you sit down
    on your mac."

  content: "As an ex imd student you will be happy to hear they are hammering this
    method of designing into us current students!  At first I hated drawing out plans
    etc I just wanted to start coding and design using css but now I am finding it
    so much easier to put ideas down on paper as you can \"see the bigger picture\".
    \ \r\n\r\nI find pen and paper works really well when making web apps, as you
    are usually making a number or screens and views.  Its also easier to scrap an
    idea on paper if it's not working out rather than scraping five hours worth of
    code experimentation!"

  content: "Have to totally agree Lee. Always get busy on paper first with designs
    and layouts before Photoshop or Illustrator are fired up.\r\n\r\nPurchased an
    A4 Web design sketch book a while back which has different sized grid layouts
    with browser chrome details on them. \r\nAvailable to purchase here: http://www.inventis.be/blog/buy-your-webdesign-sketchbook-here\r\n\r\nGuess
    my ideal solution would be to scale that sketch book up to A3 like you use with
    the grid layouts included as I find A4 a bit confined sometimes.\r\n\r\nBeen wire-framing
    with a cool online app called HotGloo as well: http://www.hotgloo.com\r\nLike
    your new site design. Nice, clean work."

    its just like working on a pad of paper, but without the pile of paper on the

  content: I use loose sheets of A4 paper and a pencil for everything from pseudo-sitemaps,
    to layout sketches, to follow-up questions for the client. A lot of this gets
    transferred to electronic form at later points for organization's sake, but I
    find it easier to always start ideas on paper.

  content: I just bought a new printer (Epson Stylus Photo TX800FW) which has a "Print
    ruled paper" option. This can print out a light-blue ruled graph paper (about
    5mm x 5mm). This has been great for design sketching and wireframing. I've got
    about 20-30 pages printed off and clipped onto a clipboard and it's been working
    wonderfully for me. Prior to this, I was using a spiral-bound A3 pad similar to
    yourself, which was also good. I liked the @jasonrobb example that had the printed
    3x2 page layout (joining two pages together for longer pages).

  content: Probably the most efficient way to achieve a solid design. Whether it be
    a template, mock-up, or the final product, it really does take the A3 to achieve
    everything you want out of your site. Bravo on the write up, Lee.

    you can draw out the website just like what you''re doing in the pictures above,
    and actually create the website just like that?  Aren''t we just about at the
    point now in our technology where we could do such a thing?  Probably there would
    be a few "taps" here and there... that kind of thing... and perhaps it wouldn''t
    work for extremely advanced sites, but for blogs or simple sites that are... say...
    20 pages or less could probably work!  What do you think?'

Recently James at <a href="http://www.helikopterdesign.com/archives/web-designer-one-essential/">Helikopter Design</a> asked myself and various other designers "<strong>What's the one thing you couldn't live without when designing a website?</strong>".

Rather than going for Photoshop or Coda, which are understandably popular answers, I replied with: 

<blockquote>I’ll go for A3 sheet of paper for sketching and notes – this is where all my web designs start.</blockquote>

<!--more-->

<h4>Always start on paper</h4>

A3 pads are great. They're small enough to have at the ready in your workspace but they're big enough to let your creative mind flow.

The first several steps of a project I'll use A3 paper:

<ul>
<li>Taking notes from a client or from their <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/freelance-document-templates/">website planner</a></li>
<li>Mindmapping for ideas</li>
<li>Sketching a sitemap</li>
<li>Sketching wireframes</li>
</ul>

<strong>Paper should always be your first port of call, long before you open Photoshop or your code editor. </strong>

<h4>Doesn't have to be perfect</h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonrobb/3836463737/in/set-72157621915677231/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/3836463737_2cabba3441.jpg" alt="3836463737_2cabba3441.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="375" /></a></div>

<small>Sketches above from <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonrobb">Jason Robb</a></small>

Remember your sketching isn't going to be put on display in a museum, nor is it going to be marked by your art teacher. You're aiming for rough sketches that you can identify with. Wobbly lines, thick boxes, unreadable writing, random cartoons around the page - <strong>this is all part of your sketching experience</strong>.

<strong>As long as it makes sense to you and helps you visualise the end goal, it's working.</strong>

<h4>My sketches</h4>

Examples of my sketches, which I have lying all over my desk. 

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/sketch1.jpg" alt="sketch1.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="405" /></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/sketch2.jpg" alt="sketch2.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="405" /></div>

I use a <strong>thick black marker</strong> for drawing out boxes and wireframes, <strong>thin pen</strong> for writing stuff, <strong>red pen</strong> for highlighting important stuff and a <strong>blue pen</strong> for notes.

As you can tell, I don't spend very long making them look good but this is all I need. This gives me the visualisation I need and a basis to go on.

If you don't have an A3 pad, go and buy one.

<strong><em>What do you use for sketching and wireframing?</em></strong>
