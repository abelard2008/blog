  content: "What rubbish! \r\n\r\nIt's never that simple, and why should there just
    be one solution?\r\n\r\nIf I was the client, spending thousands on a website,
    and i was given one option - i would walk away. I would want a choice?? Agreed,
    not hundreds of options, but a choice nevertheless."

  content: "Very well said. Expertize and the backing arguments behind a design decision
    is the key here. \r\nI was once put in front of a wireframe for my website new
    version, and without being given any explanations I had to say what I think. Of
    course I instantaneously got filled with doubts about every element on the page:
    \"Will this actually work?\", \"Does this Buy button really belong there?\" How
    was I supposed to tell? \r\n\r\nI said to the designer I'll think about it and
    I left. :-) Initially I thought I wanted options. But actually I needed strong
    arguments to show me that guy's authority on the matter. That simple. :-)\r\n\r\nAgain,
    nice reading!"

  content: Some excellent points raised here. You can pretty much guarantee if you
    give the client multiple options they will say 'I like this bit of this one, and
    that bit of that one' and ask if you can "merge" the designs, a lot of the time
    that's just because the client will feel like they need to have a creative input,
    but giving the process a clear direction will save a lot of headaches, not to
    mention all the extra time you will have to focus your efforts on one design.
    Great article!

  content: "I can see this as a valid argument for some projects Lee, but I can't
    say I agree in the vast majority of cases. For example, in many instances of work
    I've done, I can think of 2 directions a project could take. Presenting too many
    options is problematic I agree, but it is valid and acceptable to present 2 totally
    different ideas to a client. I think the whole \"expert\" bumf creates an aloof
    type of designer too. OK we know our stuff but equally, the client knows their
    business and we should be trying to learn as much as we can about them. If they
    decide our colour palette is wrong and they can back it up, chances are they will
    be roughly on the money. A perfect example is (and we've all done it) we've put
    a design out that we personally don't like, but understand it is the correct design
    for the client. Of course once in a while you come across the nightmare client,
    and perhaps then it is better to restrict certain aspects of the process in order
    to do the job well for them.\r\n\r\nIt's not choice paralysis to think about 2
    options properly at all, in fact it's healthy and gets you thinking about multiple
    directions for every project you do. Having said all of that, of course if you
    only have the one strong mockup, then go right ahead with it and lose the others."

  content: "Once again, Monsieur Monroe, we are of similar thinking on this matter.
    I agree. :-)\r\n\r\nAnd all of the times I gave \"options\" to a client they made
    a mess of their own website. Really quite soul destroying stuff.\r\n\r\nWhilst
    it is good to get constructive feedback from the client to better the design,
    often it's not the right type of feedback. The fact remains that a group of suits
    sitting around a table will try and call the shots based on their own ego's and
    opinions - that is what happened with this website I am referring to. \r\n\r\nI've
    developed a lot over the past few years and now I wouldn't entertain giving \"options\"
    when I know one design does meet the clients needs.\r\n\r\nP.S. I can see you
    loved David Airey's \"Logo Design Love\" book as much as myself. It was bunged
    with wisdom and advice on matters like this one. :-)"

  content: "Thanks for your comments.\r\n\r\nIt's worth following up by saying you
    should be clear about your process in your agreement or proposal. Outline the
    stages involved in your design process and ensure they're not expected to come
    back with several options.\r\n\r\nAlso, during your initial research stage, you
    should get a good feel for what type of websites your client likes and dislikes.
    This is the perfect way to cut out multiple mockups. Ask them what sites they
    like and what sites they don't like and the reason behind these.\r\n\r\n@Caroline:
    It's hard to say and of course all clients are different but if you're spending
    thousands on a website isn't it better that you're making life easier for them
    by coming up with the best solution instead of making them decide between multiple
    solutions?\r\n\r\n@Steve D: It's true that sometimes it doesn't work, but what
    I like about this is you can take away their feedback based on the first mockup,
    then tweak it to suit their needs. It might take a couple of revisions but better
    that than coming up with something completely different. Doesn't this save both
    parties time in the long run?"

  content: "I totally agree with you Lee. The most important factors to a design are
    the brief and wire framing/site mapping the content. If these are done correctly
    then the rest is merely semantics and personal preference. Any designer worth
    their salt should be able to make an informed decision on the design which can
    be tweeked after presenting the mock up to the client.\r\n\r\nPresenting a number
    of mockups is like cooking dinner from food scraps... you will get something that
    is presentable but it won't be up to Michelin Star standards!"

    are the designer, your expertise is in use to come up with the best solution for
    the client. I don't think there's anything wrong with second variation (the same
    layout, but different styling), but a second design just shows that you're unsure
    about what's been asked for.\r\n\r\nAnd Caroline...\r\nYour portfolio shows 10
    sites, so did you do 3-4 mock-ups of each one?\r\n\r\n^ See above...plus: it's
    about quality, not quantity. Yes, what you've supplied is, in respects just one
    design...but behind that is the time spent mulling over the client's requirements
    and all sorts of finicky design stuff (in respects to positioning, colour and
    type to name a few) that happen to make it. It has much more substance than just
    a single image, it's the product of hours of thought, sketching and doing."

    and that client ended up choosing different pieces of each design and turning
    it into one giant mess. In the end it was a design that had no \"why\" behind
    it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think if you listened to the clients needs effectively, you
    don't need more than one design. You should be able to accomplish the task at
    hand with one design. And I think revisions to that one design should be expected.
    It's apart of the job."

    interpret the clients brief effectively and deliver one solution, why the need
    for multiple? Too many options and too much choice is a bad thing for clients,
    the result, as Lee stated, is half-arsed."

  content: "@Caroline's comment is the root of the problem when it comes to this topic.
    I mean no disrespect Caroline, but that is the completely wrong attitude when
    it comes to design. You are paying thousands of dollars for an awesome website,
    logo, brochure, etc. You aren't paying thousands of dollars to see multiple versions.
    The value is in the final product, not in the presentation of multiple ideas,
    or even in the process really. If the FedEx logo took 20 minutes to create and
    was the designer's initial concept, does that make it any less valuable than the
    person who concepts 100 different logo types and presents a handful to the client,
    but the final design is far less successful?\r\n\r\nIn my experience, presenting
    multiple concepts results in Frankensteining the design far more often than not,
    and that's never a good thing."

    indecision to come to the fore. They have come to us seeking services, products
    and most importantly expertise. My favorite example for clients who want multiple
    choices is this; Would your plumber or electrician install multiple items so you
    can choose what looks the best? Of course not, we're not Walmart and we shouldn't
    behave as if we are. A good design brief and a rock solid contract covering revisions
    is all that you need. If the client doesn't know what they want before you commit
    a single pixel to the layout, you are headed for trouble. \r\n\r\nGerry"

  content: "Lee, totally agree with you on this one again, I have never presented
    more than one design to a client, I present it and wait for their feedback before
    altering or revising. If you can get a great fact find conducted at the beginning
    and do your research as well, there won't be an issues arising as you will know
    what your clients tastes and customer requirements are.\r\n\r\nOK its a bit different
    when your building a brand up from scratch i.e. logo, print and web needs to be
    taken into consideration so it might take a few revisions, but if your paid to
    advise on the development and identity of the customer's business then its your
    expertise their paying for.\r\n\r\nRemember if you know what your doing people
    will see that, when asked for multiple proofs by a client I would normally ask
    if their customers hire them for their expertise and trust their judgement, they
    normally say yes, so I then tell them to trust me."

  content: "I agree in principal but as Jason and Caroline said, it's never that easy.
    I have clients who are happy for me to pitch one idea and trust that it will work
    for them and that's because, after working with them for years, I know their business
    almost as much as they do. It's obviously the best way to work and saves everyone
    time and money. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, some clients will insist on two or three
    options because, either they don't really know what they want and need a starting
    point or they need to pitch the idea to their CEO. As Caroline said, if a client
    is paying thousands for a piece of design, whether it's a website, brand, or entire
    marketing campaign they will want value for money. The unfortunate thing is that
    design can be seen as a necessary evil by some companies and they will want to
    make sure that they are getting their moneys worth.\r\n\r\nThere are obvious limits,
    and I have been guilty of occasionally over servicing some clients myself, but
    you need to weigh up how much the entire account is worth. If you're taking a
    few thousand a year then the extra effort probably isn't worth it. If it's a lot
    more then I would rather pitch a couple of ideas than risk losing the client to
    someone who would be willing to go that extra mile. \r\n\r\nWho's to say the additional
    design's have to go to waste? In this new eco-friendly climate why not recycle?"

  content: "I think it depends on the budget and the client. Some clients just take
    it for granted that if they are paying £££ amount that they will be shown multiple
    options and will be surprised if they only get one.\r\n\r\nHowever the most options
    I have ever presented to a client have been two and when this is the case the
    designs are drastically different. I don't see the point in presenting two slightly
    different designs. In this situation I will produce one design that in my head
    is the right answer for the client, usually this will be the design which is following
    current trends. After that I will force myself to come up with something completely
    different, but something I'm equally happy with. \r\n\r\nFor me this is a good
    exercise as it can help to break out of trends which as we know are simply \"what
    everyone else is doing\".\r\n\r\nMost of the time the client will pick the first
    design, sometimes asking for elements from the second. Recently I was required
    to present a design for a HTML version of a website and one for a Flash based
    version. The client decided they preferred the look of the \"Flash\" site but
    took our advice on the benefits of an HTML based site. In this case it has led
    to quite an interesting direction for the website.\r\n\r\nUsually though, it's
    one concept based on signed off wireframes that is presented to the client. They
    provide feedback and the project moves forward, simple.\r\n\r\nI think we designers
    need to stop being so precious about our designs, listen to the clients and accept
    that sometimes, just sometimes they actually know their own business better than
    us."

  content: "A great read Lee. Personally feel that as others have stated - budget
    should dictate somewhat how many options they get. \r\n\r\nWhilst I agree completely
    on what you've stated about the design decisions (UI / UX etc)  being reached
    prior to showcasing to a client, the aesthetics and 'look and feel' are a completely
    different matter, and are subject to tastes. Clients are flippant in this regard
    \ - 'Pink is a bit girly etc etc'\r\n\r\nThese are often bundled together un-necessarily
    as 'the solution' when in reality they are two different things. Separating the
    decisions you've made from the look and feel often results in a much quicker turnaround
    in the next iteration when a client does provide feedback and  say they dont like
    a colour or photo in a particular place etc.\r\n\r\nThanks for the kind words
    earlier BTW. :)\r\n\r\nPaul"

  content: '@Gerry, while I agree whole-heartedly with most of what you said, I have
    to disagree with the plumber/electrician analogy. We aren''t fixing a sink or
    installing a light fixture. We''re communicating someone else''s message and in
    a very visual manner at that. Would you hire a painter to paint your house and
    not expect to have a say-so in the color selection and/or see some options? I
    think it''s a mixture of the two analogies. While I think showing one mockup is
    fine, I also think that it''s far more of a team journey than fixing a sink is.
    I always thought it was best to present the best option and work with the client
    to mold it into the proper solution, visually and from a communication standpoint.
    Plumbers and electricians aren''t faced with the problem of sharing someone else''s
    message with the world.'

  content: "@Lee Thinking about it, if you mean taking your first and only mockup
    to the client fairly early on in the process, then  of course this is a perfectly
    valid method of working. But to highlight what I was pointing out, I'll use a
    real life example. I was once asked to brand a sandwich shop. The client had a
    half-clear idea about what they wanted to be branded as. Once I'd met the staff
    and his team I ended up with 2 clearly defined brands in my head, one was a bubble
    lettering style with \"typical\" sandwich shop colours, and the other was a more
    rustic and gave them an option they hadn't considered. I presented them with both
    ideas and as I mentioned before, there was no confusion, just 2 very clear directions
    that they could take their companies visual language. I believe it also reaffirmed
    the quality of the work we could/would produce for them once we were rolling with
    the project. I know i saves time to an extent rather than working on iterations
    that will possibly not be used, I was suggesting really that in my experience
    it can be beneficial to do 2. Unless the 2nd idea is complete rubbish of course!
    :-)\r\n\r\nPlus I would agree with @Chris Adams that we should endorse what our
    clients know as they are then working with whatever we produce for the next few
    years or so. Creating that team journey can also develop good relations leading
    to further referrals, more work and lends itself to giving customer satisfaction."

  content: "Whilst this is not a session to shoot Lee down, it's an impossible argument,
    and completely up to the individual.\r\n\r\nAs a designer I would discuss the
    clients needs with the client, I would then provide them with wireframes, maybe
    with options of doing things differently. eg. if you have top horizontal navigation
    this will leave more room beneath for other content, however if you think you
    might have more navigation items than a horizontal nav would allow for, then maybe
    the vertical left nav is your best option.\r\n\r\nI design sites based around
    content management systems, which give the user the greatest of freedom, within
    my design - we give them choice, why restrict them.\r\n\r\nOnce the functional
    wireframes have been agreed we will then go into the 'look and feel' stage of
    the process. At this stage we will provide 2, maybe 3 interpretations of the clients
    brand - again providing choice.\r\n\r\nThe client does not want to be dictated
    to - do that and you will lose business. My clients trust my skills 100%. I know
    design &amp; usability better than they do, they know their business and their
    clients better than i do...web site creation is collaborative, including choices.\r\n\r\nHave
    faith in yourselves as designers - multiple choices are not 'half-arsed'. If you
    feel like doing 2 designs means they get half the attention, then put in more
    hours - make them both 100%??\r\n\r\nTime and budget are also factors - but essentially
    it's about doing a good job, my personal opinion involves 'choice'"

  content: "@Caroline\r\n\r\nSurely you should be able to dictate whether a client
    requires a horizontal or vertical navigation in the earlier consultations, before
    having to do the wireframe? Your way, to me, appears to be making the wireframes
    first, showing them to the client, asking them what kind of content you should
    be expecting, then making the choice together. The asking bit should go first.\r\n\r\nYou
    should be dictating the structure of the site by interpreting your clients needs...not
    supplying two options and holding their hand whilst they make the correct decision.\r\n\r\nLee
    says 2 designs = 50% + 50% (aka. half arsed), but you say 2 designs should = 100%
    + 100%. So essentially, you're suggesting putting in twice the amount of effort
    for 1/2 of the work to be ditched. Whether you produce 1 or 2, neither are going
    to be perfect, so 'the choice' in either scenario is going to need further work...say,
    +20% ? Lee = 120%, Caroline = 220%. But, as you say, 'time and budget are also
    factors'...so where are you plucking these free hours of work?\r\n\r\nI'm not
    taking a dig, I'm just honestly curious to your design model.\r\n\r\nPS. Phrase

  content: "Good to see a discussion going on.\r\n\r\nOf course, I'm not saying you
    should dictate to your clients \"Here's your design, that's it\". You should work
    with them to address their concerns, focusing on their brand, market and typical
    user. And as I said, make amendments until they are happy with the finished product.
    But saying \"Here's two ideas, pick your favourite\" is not the way to go.\r\n\r\n@Steve
    D: My bad, I should have pointed out that I'm referring to web design in this
    post.  In your example, I can understand if you're designing a logo you may come
    up with several ideas at several stages so all areas are explored. But I don't
    think this applies to web design."

    you can create multiple mock-ups and A/B tests for user/usability testing, etc.
    \r\nBut once you've come out of that process, with all you've learned, with your
    experience and expertise as a designer, then by-and-large and with very few exceptions,
    the client's feedback with regard to layout and design will have much weaker rationale
    than will yours. \r\n\r\nThe client's feedback is nonetheless important - since
    it relates to a brand that they have nurtured and grown over time - and should
    be considered, but there's no reason why this can't be worked out in the context
    of a single mock-up."

  content: "It's a sad reality that most clients are indeed such idiots that they
    cannot handle the simple process of selecting a product they like out of a multitude
    of variations.\r\n\r\nIf the supermarket offers you 20 jars of jam, calmly go
    over them and pick one that seems good. Why can't the average human accomplish
    this simple task?\r\n\r\nSure, you can be in a hurry, I get that. But what about
    the people who aren't in a hurry?\r\nHow is it that their attention-span is so
    short that they give up on the product.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, the thing with the jars
    isn't completely applicable to design mockups. With the jars, it's not a product
    you have to buy, you just run in to it at the market.\r\n\r\nThe mockups are something
    the client ordered in advance. And if it's for business, than the client will
    be serious about it(I hope). The client wanted it and now receives it. He's expecting
    to work with it. That's not the same as the jars, which are randomly encountered.\r\n\r\nCompare
    it to a large amount of text. If you randomly run in to it somewhere on the web,
    you'll probably skip it, because it's way too much. If you're actively seeking
    info on something and are met with a large amount of text, the motivation to dig
    through the info is much greater.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem is with this line:\r\n\"If
    you show a client two mockups and one has navigation down the left and one along
    the top and ask “which is your favourite?” you’re degrading  your expertise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly,
    you have expertise. But to claim that it must be followed at all times, is a hollow
    argument.\r\n\r\nTo create both mockups, you used your expertise each time. Or
    didn't you? Did you just make the first one and then decided it's the best and
    that all after it would be bad?\r\n\r\nDesigning isn't about you, it's about your
    customer. You're deliberately shielding the customer from other options. As designer,
    you should realize that it's rubbish to say that there's only 1 good design for
    a concept. All things can be displayed in more than 1 way. Put yourself behind
    all the mockups, not just 1 thing you like.\r\n\r\nThis isn't degrading your expertise,
    it's using your expertise each time and letting the client choose. The person
    making the final judgment is the client, not the designer. The designer filters
    out the bad elements and puts up several good solutions. The client picks one.\r\n\r\nAnd
    since they're all good, there's no such thing as \"degrading your expertise\".\r\n\r\nUnless
    of course you either consider it too much effort to make more than one, or just
    think you know it all and the customer is dumb for disagreeing with you."

    first is a great way to explore a few different directions (as far as feel/color/typography
    goes): mood boards. These come from in depth discussions with the client, don't
    take nearly as long as a full on design and can help the client pick the right
    mood from the get go. \r\n\r\nAdd some wireframes for structure and hierarchy
    and you really do end up with just one design where everyone knows how you got
    there.\r\n\r\nIt's a no surprises, collaborative process and is working pretty
    well so far."

    four designs, but in those cases I've tried to restrict the best ideas to either
    the first design or the first two and really just fluffing (whether this is right
    or not) the third or fourth design which I know they would never choose.\r\n\r\nAs
    many have already said, it depends on the client and the project but I personally

    story.\r\n\r\nSo it helps an awful lot if you sweat the content creation and organization
    process together with the client before doing any design. As a lot of design decisions
    follow from  the content, it will be much easier for the client to understand
    the design and for you to motivate it."

  content: "Lee,\r\n\r\nI couldn't agree with this more. In those early days I used
    to bust myself to complete 3 designs within the budgeted days of the contract.
    What this resulted in was one design that I really worked hard on to be unique
    and include nice aesthetic elements, one design that was a 'safe' design (by which
    I mean one that was a little boring) and one that I basically grabbed from a previous
    project that went unused. Every time the client went with the 'Safe' option meaning
    that my funky, cool design went unused and alot of time was wasted.\r\n\r\nIn
    the, and after reading Mark Boltons book, I decided to propose only one design
    to the client based on a more detailed requirements process (with specific attention
    being placed on what they did and did not like about other website). This design
    would lean more towards the 'safe' design that they would have originally got
    with a few aesthetic embellishments to let it stand out. I allow an additional
    2 rounds of tweaks based on their feedback before we sign-off on the final design.\r\n\r\nAt
    first I was unsure about this process but at this stage it has stood the test
    of time and now we are finding a greater level of success with our output. Sometime
    this process needs to be explained to the client as for some reason many of them
    do expect a selection of designs from which to chose. Heck in some instances I've
    had clients ask me for a link to our templates so they could pick one that they
    liked! We have this 'template site' now but only as one of our website packages.
    Where possible we lean the customer towards a bespoke design if we feel that this
    will suit their requirements better.\r\n\r\nAnyway, another great article from
    you good sir! Keep up the excellent work!"

    agree that a designer's expertise always trumps a client's opinion. They probably
    know their business much better than you do and should always be given the opportunity

    to make the same web page, each designer is going to present a different solution.
    Sure, core elements (navigation, search bar, etc) will most likely mirror each
    other in location in each rendition; however, they will not be exact replicas.
    \r\n\r\nWhen in the exploratory stages of design a lot roads that look promising

    them the option of choosing whichever one they like best. However in my experience
    what ended up happening is that it became obvious which designs ended up being
    picked and as such I reapplied this to one single strong design with a strong
    discovery phase rather than giving multiple design options. I have yet to have
    a client come back and outright shoot down that initial design - so far!!\r\n\r\nClearly

    up with what you think is the best option, present that one to your client. Don't
    think \"Great, that's one good mockup sorted, now lets start all over again because
    I better show them another option\".\r\n\r\nLike I said before, in the research
    stage show them different layouts of existing sites and get a feel for what they

  content: Lee, I think you're right - I don't think you should create additional
    options just for the sake of it. If you feel that you've got one strong idea after
    a really good research phase then that may be enough. However, if your discovery
    phase wasn't as thorough as it could be, then you might be better off offering
    additional options. I have found that clients love to have a choice and it just
    increases your chance of getting approval and moving on. In all the digital agencies
    I've worked in, we factor this into the budget so spending time on it is not generally
    a problem.

    to action might be, technical functionality needs ~ basic info architecture stuff.
    Form follows function.\r\n\r\nThen we go to a wireframe. We go through multiple
    revisions of the wireframe before we ever get to the design.\r\n\r\nWe always
    offer, depending on the contract price, 2-3 design comps for a website. However,
    we produce them one at a time. If the client doesn't like the first comp at all
    ~ which is very rare ~ then we move to additional comps if necessary. Usually
    what happens is that MOST of the first design is accepted, and then we're into
    tweaks rather than complete redesign.\r\n\r\nSo I agree, but there's no reason
    not to OFFER additional design comps as part of the original contract. That way
    you're covered financially if they're needed, and if they're not, then you've

    just one option. You should at least have a variation of the design that doesn't
    stray too far from the original. Enough to show variety, but not enough to spin
    out of control or become a Frankenstein site. Possibly a color palette and type
    face variation or minor layout change. But definitely not multiple extremes of

    try to take critique and client suggestions into account when doing any resulting

    taking in account the research and info they've provided... 'choices' can be unclear

  content: "Just to sidestep the conversation slightly I have noticed in a few of
    the comments people talking about the topic of Project Ownership. Some have criticised
    that only showing 1 design removes an element of control from the client. Others
    have argued that showing only 1 design somehow enforces our will onto the client
    by giving them no scope for moving away from our vision for their website.\r\n\r\nI
    would like to explain my take on this, and this goes back to my days as a project
    manager on system installations. I always make a point of explaining to the client
    (or customer as the case can sometimes be with us) that we are only facilitators
    in helping them create their website. We advise as best we can and make sure that
    we are always available when they need us. We also don't want them to feel overwhelmed
    since in many cases that client might still be running a full time business whilst
    only being able to devote portions of time to the website. There can be a pretty
    tricky balancing act in there at times. \r\n\r\nHowever for the most part we always
    remind the client that the website is their project and to never keep any thoughts
    or feelings to themselves. If we show a design and it isn't what they had in mind
    then they are always free to send us back to the drawing board to go again. Now
    obviously the budget plays a big part in the amount of freedom that we have here
    but we can set those expectations at an early stage.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is
    that I still feel strongly that a single design proposal based on a strong requirements
    gathering stage will usually result in the best option for the client. I've even
    had experiences where, after we've submitted our designs, that the client has
    signed off on it despite not being what they had in mind. This is because what
    they had in mind wasn't quite as good as what we delivered... hey, it happens!"

    isn't the best but what about artists, or any industry for that matter, creative
    or not. We don't expect our print suppliers to supply us with two finished brochure
    prints, for us then to then choose one. All the choice and development should
    come during the briefing stage.\r\n\r\nDesign is a creative process and different
    ideas should be tried and some used but some not but we should never supply two
    answers to the same brief to the client. All that does is highlight that we're
    not fully comfortable with either.\r\n\r\nAs designers were employed to make a
    decision between solutions for the client based on our knowledge and experience
    and their brief and input. We should be confident in our own ability to get it
    right.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, if it works for you to produce more than one version

    any decent client will have provided this as their planning process]. From that
    I'll create a preview to which I ask for constructive criticism and feedback,
    with the intention of altering or continuing my tangent as appropriate.\r\n\r\nGiving
    a choice is noble idea, but when you plan properly you should be able to go in
    the right direction for your clients needs from the outset - without worrying
    about the possibility your client may backtrack and change their mind as they've
    developed a fondness of design option B, rather than C that you've been working
    on since day one... It also means that you develop one idea in the right direction,
    not come up with another potential miss on the exploration of finding what client
    likes as they're indecisive or unsure.\r\n\r\nIt's always going to be a development
    progression from using one idea or several so multiple versions are ultimately
    encountered either way. As long as clients understand 'changes = time' and you
    communicate regularly, it usually results in a better end product."

    done, we already know where the site is headed. I've never had an issue with any
    client because I only offer them one fully loaded design option. Communication
    is the key.

  content: Great post Lee. As I've read through these comments I can see where some
    of these readers are coming from, however I'd have to agree with you. I think
    one design comp should be enough, but if you do go with one design comp I think
    it is a great idea to share it with another fellow designer before sending it
    off. Having more than one design helps you pick up your mistakes I believe, so
    if you were to only present one design comp to a client, it is best to get a second
    opinion before sending it off.

  content: "@dan @lee:  I'm new to this blog so I really don't know your backgrounds
    but from an agency perspective you land a deal with a client for 30k+ job and
    you have multiple designers on staff I would pick two designers you feel would
    best fit the specified project and have them both flesh out a concept. I'm not
    suggesting define your business model off of how much money you pay is how many
    concepts you get by any means. \r\n\r\nI don't think that one designer need do
    more that one developed concept. Although I do expect them to have more than one
    sketch or idea to choose from (internally) before fleshing it all out. \r\n\r\nIf
    a client is going to pay that much for a site the scope is definitely the largest
    determinant of cost but creating the best possible solution for them is your job
    and it should be handled by a team (if independent, bounced off other creatives)."

    more about the people I'm communicating with.  \r\n\r\nI'm an independent designer/developer
    and I know exactly where you're coming from. I myself have never presented more
    than one \"design\" to a client.  After going through the process of 1. Research/Marketing,
    2. Wire-framing, 3 Design, 4. Development there really should be no surprise when
    the design rolls around.  \r\n\r\nThe point we're debating is with the agency
    model.  Wether they should show multiple ones to the client. I think that lies
    with the creative director and his or her confidence.  Ideally he should only
    show the client the best solution. \r\n\r\nI think agencies are afraid to show
    just one because of the fear of them not liking it. Especially when there is a
    larger price tag associated with it. Now I don't believe they should be afraid
    at all but I've known many that have been. Personally I've never been afraid to
    present a design/concept to a client.\r\n\r\nThis brings up the question of weather
    a client should have one decision maker for the project or have a committee. Almost
    the same argument but from the other side of the table. Design by committee never

    needs to feel that he is involved in the process, that his opinion counts. \r\n\r\nDesign
    decisions are not solely the domain of the professional, as much as designers
    sometimes think they are or should be.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't necessarily mean presenting
    more than one option, but it does mean allowing the client to partake in the process.
    Show him the wireframe, with rationale. Show him the colour palette, with rationale.
    Get a signoff at every stage. Keep them involved at every stage. If you've chosen
    a dark blue and the client isn't convinced that it's right, humour him and show
    him a lighter blue, this is not the same as showing multiple 'finished' designs.
    It's the process of exploration, to move from something indeterminate to a possible
    'right' solution.  \r\n\r\nAs mentioned by others, the client usually know their
    business better than the designer does. Collaboration with the client is not the
    same as design by committee. It is our job to back up a design proposal with a
    solid rationale, referring back to the clients brief. \r\n\r\nIt's through good
    communication with the client, early on in the design process, and every step
    of the way, that we win the clients confidence. The client will not feel the need
    to get his nephew to look over our designs if he understands and has confidence
    in the process we take them through.\r\n\r\nNever say no to a client, instead
    say: Yes, we can do that, however that would result in \"rationale against the
    clients request\", is that what you want?"

    really answers what we're all talking about here. Of course, it takes a seasoned
    designer with a large body of work to make such bold statements, but at the same
    time, it shows what I think we should all aspire to. My comments about good communication,
    a solid rationale, and winning your clients confidence fit with what Steve Jobs
    says about Paul Rand.\r\n\r\nSteve Jobs talks about Paul Rand, who designed the
    apple logo:\r\n\r\nHe really approached it as a problem that needed to be solved,
    not as an artistic challenge for it's own sake. He is one of the most professional
    people I've ever worked with, in the sence that he'd thought through the formal
    relationship between a client and a professional such as himself. Therefore he
    had very clear conclusions about what the relationship meant to both parties and
    how it should be conducted, and I asked him if he would come up with a few options.
    And he said: \r\n\r\n\"No, I will solve your problem for you, and you will pay
    me. You don't have to use the solution, if you want options, go talk to other
    people, but I'll solve your problem for you the best way I know how, and you use
    it or not, that's up to you, you're the client.\""

  content: "—coming from a web site design angle—\r\n\r\nI agree (especially on the
    issue of feedback and reiteration), but there are a few more angles to this. We
    prefer the single option in our large education institution, and thats for a number
    of reasons; in dealing with committees and too many options you tend to get everyone
    wanting their opinion implemented. The result is a 'dogs breakfast'. You need
    to do as much of the hard decision making before you go to the committee, while
    leaving enough choice for the group to feel useful by clarifying uncertain areas.
    In part the designer also needs to be a very good salesperson, communicator, presenter
    and diplomat.\r\n\r\nWe also work on tiny budgets, so theres not the time or justification
    for multiple attempts. In corporate environments there are often fairly tight
    constraints on various branding/identity elements with new sites needing to fit
    the 'house style'. Many sites are often add-ons or adaptations of existing sites
    and probably are built around a template/CMS with its own constraints. All of
    this works in favour of a single well-considered design.\r\n\r\nOne very important
    thing to make clear is that the single design presented is the result of much
    sketching, testing and playing with ideas that could easily have been shown to
    the client as possible design directions. That single design is not as simple
    as some folk here have implied.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I often make as part of my client
    presentation of a design a little background to my process, showing the various
    directions I went but abandoned, and explaining why. The client gets to see that
    you are in fact 'the expert' and understands why you got to that single point.
    They appreciate the inclusiveness while at the same time you are building trust
    and 'educating' them for the design process next time. Often you get agreement
    with small changes. Worst case, is a reworked iteration of the design – not a
    redesign. Iterations are expected and good, but not the same as inventing entirely
    different designs."

    as this is a part of designing in the first place.\r\n\r\nPresenting the client
    with one or two variations (only little differences), shows them that I did my
    homework, looked into every possible solution and I did a thorough research. Just
    to make it clear, when I'm talking about variations I do not present a complete

    how much more a client that only has a vague notion of what they truly want. \r\n\r\nApple's
    Macintosh products are an excellent example. Apple offers just enough variation
    that customers feel that they have choice. Their balance sheet and income statement

    to suggest that most clients have multiple people with disparate needs contributing
    to the overall vision of a given project. \r\n\r\nGood organizations have often
    made their compromises before presenting their RFP, whether formal or not. Upon
    new information being offered by the design team, rather than a single unified
    vision, multiple ideas emerge from clients—sometimes competing or ambiguous. It
    is their responsibility to make the compromises necessary to result in a  harmonious
    mosaic. More than one interpretation gets them to see the big picture faster."

    Some great points raised, and I must agree in some cases the one concept design will work - but in many other cases  I can see a project heading in two possible directions.

    Thanks for the great post...

  content: Good point here. I was actually considering the idea of producing more
    than 1 mockup.  I can't remember what post I read, but it suggested that I create
    more than one mockup.

    A short quick read that convinces me to stop doing two mockups!

    Previously I had always done 2 mockups and the client would always choose the wrong one.  I made up for the "time lost" from doing the second mockup by turning it into a free Wordpress Theme to give away to promote myself, however I really think I will start giving the client 1 option.  I am the expert right?

  content: There are some great comments here.  As designers of anything we have to
    learn not to be apologetic for our talents.  I've been designing buildings for
    30 years and I have never won a project with the three option stratagy.  It detracts
    from your expertise and confuses the client.  I've also found that you never send
    a "preview".  It's imperitive to stay in control and explain the story at the
    presentation.  In my humble opinion - great design is not a democratic process
    - it's a benevolent dictatorship.

  content: I totally get it, I'm doing two mockups right now for a client and everything
    your saying is the truth. After I'm done with this client, I'm only doing one
    mockup for now on. Thanks bro, this was a good read!

  content: I agree completely. I learned the hard way. You need to do your preliminary
    work of talking with the client and getting a firm idea of what they are looking
    for, then you can get their feedback on changes they may want after they have
    seen the 1 mock-up.

I often hear designers talk about how they need to do 2 or 3 mockups for a project so the client can pick their favourite.

Back when I was starting out as a web designer, I undertook some work for a design firm. I too remember at the time being asked to <strong>come up with 2 or 3 mockups for each project</strong> that went my way, then the sales guy would show them to the client and <strong>the client would pick their favourite</strong>.

<!--more-->

<h4>Never supply a client with more than one option</h4>

<strong>You should have final decision based on your expertise.</strong> If you show a client two mockups and one has navigation down the left and one along the top and ask "which is your favourite?" you're <strong>degrading</strong> your expertise. <strong>You should know what the best option is and be able to back up your design decisions.</strong>

<h4>Choice paralysis</h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/colour.gif" alt="colour.gif" border="0" width="400" height="300" /></div>

There's a good story in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1846680166?ie=UTF8&tag=10homepa-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1846680166">Yes! 50 secrets from the science of persuasion</a> about jars of jam for sale in a supermarket. <strong>Give the customer too many options, they'll get confused and walk away. Narrow the options and they're more likely to buy it.</strong>

Same goes with design. <strong>Presenting too many options over complicates things</strong> and the customer thinks about it too much.

<strong>They'll also pick the option you didn't want them to pick.</strong> Trust me, it'll happen.

<h4>More work for you</h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/layout1.gif" alt="layout1.gif" border="0" width="400" height="300" /></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/layout2.gif" alt="layout2.gif" border="0" width="400" height="300" /></div>

Why produce more work for yourself? If you're spending a number of days researching, wireframing and mocking up for one design, why would you want to do that all over again? <strong>Put all your effort and attention into one design, the one that you believe, as a professional, works best for your client.</strong>

If you split your workload in two, the outcome is going to be two half-assed efforts, rather than one <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=full-assed">full-ass</a>.

<h4>Client isn't getting the best</h4>

If you have to come up with more than one design it undoubtedly means that your first design isn't the best, or your second design isn't the best. If they were the best, there would be no need for another design. 

<strong>One mockup allows you to focus all your expertise and attention to what you feel is the best solution for your client.</strong>

<h4>But what if my client doesn't like it?</h4>
You can't always get it right first time but you can <strong>take on board their feedback and iterate</strong>.

Make sure you <strong>encourage good feedback</strong>. Good feedback includes <strong>a good reason</strong> as to why they don't think something will work.

e.g. "I don't like blue" is not good feedback. "I don't think the blue works because it's very corporate and we want to show our customers we're fun and creative" is a lot better as now you know the reason behind their thinking so you can work with this, plus they're keeping their users and target market in mind instead of letting personal preferences get in the way.

You can then go and make the necessary amendments to satisfy each of the feedback points.

<h4>What do you think?</h4>

Some designers can't help it and are told to produce 2, 3 or 4 mockups. Some maybe prefer to do it this way.

<strong><em>What's your approach? Do you present more than one mockup? Is it your choice or are you made to?</em></strong>
