  content: "Sending the user a temporary password is a really bad idea. Most of them
    don't bother changing it, so they end up using that. Until they are logged out
    and can't remember it.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's not just that \"facebook can get away
    with it, you can't\". Facebook asked for those data right from the start. Most
    users don't fill in optional information. So yeah, if you ask for less data, you
    end up with more accounts, but with emptier accounts. Whether that's a good thing
    depends on the nature of your app. It's a tradeoff: More users vs more data/user.
    For facebook, obviously more complete user profiles is more important than more
    user profiles. This is why they are asking for more data, not just because they
    can."

  content: "Interesting article there, Lee. \r\n\r\nWhen you launched your new site
    here I noticed the way you have crafted your comment form here to encourage users
    to write a comment first before they have to fill in their details - this works.
    And anyone who know's their UX would notice the thought poured into it too.\r\n\r\nA
    lot of people do take these things for granted and do focus too much on making
    things 'look' right before they focus on making them engaging. \r\n\r\nI would
    love to read that book, but I have been slacking on my reading lately. I will
    add it to my wishlist though!"

  content: "Another interesting article Lee and one that will no doubt spawn another
    heated debate on the topic at hand. While I do agree with what you say in regards
    to keeping the sign up process as simple as possible I also believe that we are
    at the stage now where users are a little more experienced with the web and can
    make their way through a sign up process such as Facebook use with little effort.
    I do not see their sign up form as being too much.\r\n\r\nI also prefer and am
    in favour of the idea of account activation via email verification as in the long
    run this should create a richer userbase. The same goes for email sign-ups with
    an email being to sent to the user to confirm that they wish to opt in. It might
    mean lesser sign up and email addresses but in theory the quality if user should
    be better.\r\n\r\nThe captchas I'm not so keen on. I mean do these really stop
    spam accounts being created or are they just a nuisance to the user - especially
    when accessibility is taken into consideration? I've had a few clients ask for
    them and I've explained my thoughts on them. Sometimes the client has insisted
    that they be included anyway and others have dropped them altogether.\r\n\r\nI
    agree that what should be required for sign up should be the bare minimum of information
    with completion of other elements not being required until after log in - such
    as what you use for Lookaly. I think that this process works best in most scenarios."

  content: "I completely agree with gradual engagement, and recently I had to strip
    back a form from about 16 fields to 4 fields and the change has resulted in a
    greater uptake than before.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be careful of though if you're
    using Twitter oAuth, Facebook Connect or OpenID, for the sake of the user make
    sure you get enough information in your system to enable them to recover an account
    at your site if they ever decide to leave Twitter, Facebook or OpenID.\r\n\r\nFacebook
    recommends it as part of their account retrieval process and documents it quite
    well, but the basics include keeping hold of the user's email account on your
    system at the very least.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that one of the first sites
    to use Facebook Connect saw a massive jump in signups when they implemented it
    versus just having their own signup process.  This is probably similar to the
    Amazon buy button effect."

  content: "Nice post Lee. \r\n\r\nI think TripIt really pushed the boat out by skipping
    signup altogether. \r\n\r\nThe key point is that often sign up should be a by-product
    of whatever you're doing, it's not something the user wants to do, they want to
    use your application. If it's possible to slip a sign up in there painlessly,
    then that's the best way to do it. \r\n\r\nAdaptive Path have some great stuff
    on it, in their Designing patterns for Ramp &amp; Sign up PDF http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/reports/signup/\r\n\r\nAlso,

  content: "Nice article Lee. This is quite important consideration when designing
    signup forms and the entire signup processes. Another pattern that can be considered
    is lazy registration where signup comes only after visitor actually used the site/app.
    Picnik.com is one of my favorite examples.\r\n\r\nI disagree with some of the
    comments saying that it's \"quality over quantity\" and that \"users are more
    experienced and that they can use a little more effort to complete tasks\". More
    fields in signup form certainly doesn't guarantee quality. And users should be
    able to perform their tasks with minimum efforts, unless it is absolutely necessary
    to involve complexity.\r\n\r\niPlotz.com is a great example of how signup process
    can be simple.\r\n\r\nLuke's book is simply amazing, a must have in a bookshelf."

    to challenge you on something though, or, at least, get your opinion.\r\n\r\nA
    gradual engagement or low barrier to entry signup is good to generate volume interest.
    However, do you see value in a more Facebook-like signup form if you want to attract
    only the most interested, engaged, and/or valuable users?\r\n\r\nYou'll certainly
    get fewer users as a result. But, those that do will be committed.\r\n\r\nThere
    are flaws with this notion and I think the right kind of gradual engagement would
    address this, but what do you think of the core idea?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  content: "@Lea: Fair point. I've never implemented this method myself to be fair,
    although I do usually change the password as soon as I'm in (to apps that do use
    this) - maybe a reminder of some sort on all pages to change your password is
    a good solution?\r\n\r\n@Mark: Indeed, a strategic move based on letting the user
    contribute first.\r\n\r\n@Gareth: Fair point, the Facebook sign up form isn't
    really too much for Facebook, but it would be for other apps e.g. if someone tweets
    \"Check out my new web service\" I'll go check it out but I'll then think twice
    about signing up if presented with the same fields that Facebook presents me with.
    And agreed, captchas are a bitch (there must be a better way by now)\r\n\r\n@Alex:
    Sweet - can you share the website? Interesting to hear how much value Facebook
    Connect can add to a site. Should really get it on the go for Lookaly.\r\n\r\n@Des:
    Thanks Des, TripIt is another excellent example - great link too http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/reports/signup/\r\n\r\n@Janko:
    iPlotz and Piknik - great examples! Was looking for some examples like this earlier.\r\n\r\n@Brad:
    You raise a fair point. I think once you get more established you can afford to
    do this (Facebook, Google, Yahoo etc. always ask for more) but if you're relatively
    new and no one has heard of you, you usually want as many new people to try you
    out as quick as possible. Of course you can use the foot in the door technique,
    where your sign up has more than 1 step e.g. Step 1: email, password Step 2: name,
    location, avatar etc."

    (Facebook gathers the information they do because they need to prevent under 13s
    from being on the site, as per rules to marketing to minors.) With those requirements
    in mind, Facebook's UX actually does a good job at presenting the least number
    of forms possible while still being legally enforcable.\r\n\r\nAren't marketing
    rules wonderful? Often, that's why all of the form fields exist, especially on
    sites with advertising/contests - it's information you must have to talk to your

  content: I agree 100%.  The less info I have to give the better.  Get me in the
    door or lose me.  The challenge then is all those dead accounts or the zombie
    accounts - where people walk around your forum or discussion group or whatever
    it is with no sig line and no avatar (that's the worst).  There needs to be some
    sort of control for that.  Perhaps in the case of a forum, thread-starting priviledges
    start when certain fields have been filled in on the profile.

    getting a user to sign up with email address you can test if they already have
    a \"gravatar\" assigned to that email address.\r\n\r\nIf they don't, the form
    could then update to suggest to the user to upload a photo. this increases a form
    by one field - granted effort required on the user's part to upload the photo

Lets be honest. Sign up forms suck.

As designers we often get carried away with how a sign up form looks and forget about the user experience. Border here, rounded corners there, maybe a hint of shadow...

Truth is users don't care about how it looks. They care about getting through the form as <strong>quickly</strong> as possible. They care about what <strong>information you're asking for</strong> and why you need it. They care about <strong>getting access</strong> to your website or app so they can start using it.

<!--more-->


<h4>What's the minimum amount of data you need to let someone in?</h4>

Ask yourself "Do I need to know this right now?"

<h5>Email address</h5>
The one thing you need to create an account is most likely an email address.

Everyone online has at least one email address so this is the perfect way to identify someone using your app and when you have their email you can contact them, send them setup details, keep them up-to-date.

<h5>Password</h5>
You more than likely need a password as well to let users into your app.

That said you can always email them a password then let them change it later, for the sake of giving them even quicker access.

It's debatable whether you need a field to <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/confirm-passwords-signup/">confirm the user's password</a> or not.

<h5>Username</h5>
If your app involves some sort of public profile, you'll need a username that will identify the person. This username can then be used for login, as well as their email.

<h5>What you (probably) don't need to know "right now"</h5>
<ul>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Zip/post code</li>
<li>Gender of the user</li>
<li>First name</li>
<li>Last name</li>
</ul>
All these are extra fields that will potentially <strong>scare your user away</strong>.

I don't know what the stats are but I guarantee sign up forms that have these required fields end up getting a good lot of Joe Bloggs, born on 1st January from Beverly Hills 90210. Why? Because users just want quick access and they'll enter the first thing that comes to mind that doesn't lead back to them.

<h4>Gradual engagement</h4>
I've been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1933820241?ie=UTF8&tag=leemunroe-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1933820241">Web Form Design: Filling In The Blanks</a>, where <a href="http://www.lukew.com/">Luke Wroblewski</a> talks about gradual engagement.

Lets look at this process.

<h5>Sign up process 1: Facebook</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://facebook.com"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/facebook.jpg" alt="facebook.jpg" border="0" width="465" height="329" /></a></div>

<ol>
<li>I'm presented with this form. This is enough to turn me away as there are quite a few fields.</li>
<li>After submitting these details I have to complete a captcha for anti-spam.</li>
<li>I successfully sign up but an activation link has been sent to my email and I need to verify. I have to leave the site now to check my mail.</li>
<li>Verification email link clicked. Thankfully this wasn't delayed or marked as spam.</li>
<li>I'm in. Now to complete the process, find friends etc.</li>
</ol>

See how many annoying things happened here. The thing is though, <strong>Facebook can get away with it. Your website can't.</strong> If this was another site and Facebook wasn't one of the biggest sites on the planet, you probably would have walked away by now.

<h5>Sign up process 2: Twitter</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://twitter.com"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/twitter3.jpg" alt="twitter.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="404" /></a></div>

<ol>
<li>Sign up - pretty good, bit more fields than I would like but satisfactory.</li>
<li>After submitting details I'm presented with a captcha for anti-spam.</li>
<li>Now I'm in and I can start using it.</li>
</ol>

Twitter definitely has a nicer sign up process than Facebook. They also sent me an activation email but notice how Twitter lets you into their app (with limited access) before you have to click the activation link. Good job.

<h5>Sign up process 3: Geni</h5>

Geni is a family tree web app and has a very interesting sign up process:

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://geni.com"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/geni.jpg" alt="geni.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="364" /></a></div>

<ol>
<li>You don't sign up, you just start making your family tree.</li>
</ol>

Geni has a form on the homepage that records your email address, which is all they need to setup your account, but it's cleverly disguised as part of the application so <strong>I never *really* sign up. Instead I'm jumping straight in and using the service.</strong>

Behind the scenes Geni has emailed be a temporary password to use until I create my own.

<strong>This is gradual engagement.</strong> I'm able to <strong>start using the service without actually signing up</strong>. I'm happy as there's no time wasted. They're happy as they have another user using their service.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

Try to <strong>get the user involved first</strong> before asking them to sign up, then only ask for the information you really need.

If you need email confirmation (to prevent spam accounts) l<strong>et the user continue to use your website in the mean time</strong>. Maybe close the account after a week or a month if they still haven't verified, or restrict access to certain parts of your app.

<strong>Don't scare users away with many fields</strong>. Often zip codes, DOB, even names can come later. Let them in fast.

For handiness make use of <strong>Twitter oAuth, Facebook Connect and OpenID</strong> etc. so users can sign in with 3rd party tools.

<h4>Further reading</h4>

This blog post is based on my own interpretation of a chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1933820241?ie=UTF8&tag=leemunroe-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1933820241">Web Form Design: Filling In The Blanks</a>. 

<strong>I highly recommend this book if you're a UI designer</strong> as you undoubtedly work with forms daily. If you're interested in usability, eye fixations, error prevention, web apps etc. then you should read this book.
