Ecliptic Labs are undoubtedly one of Northern Ireland's top iPhone development companies responsible for iPhone apps such as MailChimp and Used Cars NI.

As a newly established company, in early 2010 they needed a web presence that showed off their iPhone app expertise and a site that positioned them as one of the top developers in the industry.

I worked with Ecliptic to put together a website that looked good, paid attention to pixel detail and that helped show off their portfolio resulting in more enquiries.
