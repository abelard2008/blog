  content: "I think you think of it to much of a computer. As a replacement of something.
    It's a whole new thing and has a whole new target audience.\r\n\r\nI use it for
    a lot of things. And we have practically the same profession.\r\n\r\n- I like
    the games, you don't\r\n- I like reading from it, you don't\r\n- I browse a lot
    indoors, in the train, at meetings - you don't\r\n- I use it to make notes, take
    sketches when in a meeting - you don't\r\n- I watch movies (in bed, on the couch)
    - you don't\r\n- I love reading my news on an iPad - you don't\r\n\r\nSo you see
    I have a lot of point why I like using an iPad. You don't. But maybe you are just
    not the target audience. The iPad for me is media consumption. Nothing more. I
    keep creating stuff on my MBP."

    ipad but for a lot of todays technology.  As much as I am an avid "geek" in terms
    of technology, like yourself I will never actually buy something I don't actually

  content: "Couldn't agree more Lee. When it comes down to it, I'm an Apple fanboy
    but I still couldn't justify the purchase of an iPad because like you I didn't
    see how I personally would use it.\r\n\r\nI get the idea and I know there are
    some markets in which it will be very useful, but it's a consumer device, something
    which you use to explore information &amp; content but not create it and is therefore
    of little use to me and many other designers."

    and struggling to do so! I think they are a superb piece of technology, but I
    can't find a use for it that my Mac and iPhone combo doesn't already do for me.\r\n\r\nIt
    can do a lot of things for some people, but I think I'm in the same boat as yourself,
    and can't find that niche use for it. I think if I was someone who travelled a
    lot, it would be great though."

    I've been an apple fan from way back when it wasn't cool to be an apple fan and
    I haven't got an Ipad for exactly the same reasons you highlighted above. \r\n\r\nI
    refuse to upgrade my MBP to a unibody one because on long trips I carry two spare
    batteries, giving me close to 10 hours or so productive battery life in the programs
    I use and I can have access to all my files offline without needing to sync, I
    still carry around a pad and paper around the house and buy the newspaper each
    weekend because I love the feel of something in my hands that I don't worry about
    my 2 year old son grabbing and destroying."

    a presentation, then lugged it about all avo. \r\n\r\nThe opportunities to use
    it at the airport or on the plane are minimal given the hectic/crushed nature
    of those environments, whereas the iPad would be a simple, convenient alternative.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, we need a new sofa, so my iPad travel dreams won't be coming true
    anytime soon!"

    just seems like a hassle now. Its also my favorite way to read books, comics and
    watch videos. I agree with you on how much of a hassle it is to share stuff on
    Twitter and Facebook. Maybe one day Apple will build extensions into mobile Safari
    to make it easier.

  content: "I had to weigh in. \r\n\r\nAll of the commentary above says one thing:
    developers and designers have not delivered for you. \r\n\r\nGames have delivered
    for me (Mirrors Edge, Osmos) but there are some killer apps missing. Apps like
    Flipboard provide a new and useful (but sadly not multiuser) way to consume news
    and there are others. \r\n\r\nWhat's missing I guess are new creator apps. Like
    the revolution that Kai's Power Tools were for UI wayback when. \r\n\r\nFor my
    part I'd like to see what the designer of Lookaly could do with a new interface
    metaphor. Labelling any of it as a fail for you  is premature, I think. iPad (or
    one of the spiritual descendants) may yet prove to be essential for you. The apps
    (your particular itch for a touchscreen device may not yet have been scratched
    or even conceived)."

    Sun on it? \r\n\r\nI bet if you look closely at it with the power off, you will
    see, on the inside of the screen, a thin indelible imprint of insouciant innuendo,
    a masked mish-mash of muddled misanthropic morality, pointedly polemical political
    posturing and the outline of a pair of breasts.\r\n\r\nThat said, the iPad and
    similar devices that follow will probably have a high take-up from people with
    neither laptops nor iPhones, and while I agree completely about the pleasure derived
    from a physical book or newspaper, lighting and enlarged text will transform reading
    for many older people who would prefer books but find them too difficult to view."

  content: "Thanks for weighing in all. Some interesting points arising:\r\n\r\nGaming\r\nThe
    iPad is good for gaming. I can't argue with this, I'm a fan of Angry Birds as
    much as the next guy is. Although if I really want to sit down to game I'll generally
    play the Xbox. Which leads onto the next point...\r\n\r\nTravel\r\nThe iPad fits
    if you travel. Whether that be by plane, train or bus you can consume media or
    play a game with ease (where you can't bring your Xbox with you). I don't travel
    that much so this is where it hasn't fitted for me.\r\n\r\n@Rich: Enjoy the new
    sofa ;-)\r\n\r\n@George: Does sound like a good use case, accepting credit card
    payments. If you're in sales it definitely looks professional.\r\n\r\n@Joe: I
    think more or easier integration between different apps, or like you say Safari
    extensions, would definitely be useful.\r\n\r\n@Matt: Totally. I'm waiting for
    the inevitable brainwave that changes my mind. I'm certain I'll end up with another
    tablet at some stage when the right combination of use case and app(s) come along
    (whether that be the same iPad, next generation or another make). For me it doesn't
    exist yet."

  content: "I usually don't respond to obvious linkbait titled posts like this but...
    ;) \r\n\r\nI seem to be the only commenter that uses their iPad *all the freakin
    time*.  I bought it with no real use case, but I have found I love being able
    to lay back and read, not have to wait for it to power up. The battery life is
    nice too.\r\n\r\nI use it mainly for consumption, so it's not going to replace
    my laptop. But when I'm not at work, it gets a lot of use.\r\n\r\nI was surprised
    at your summary that all apps suck, I would agree that most free apps are not
    that great, but there are a few that shine. I still think it's so early yet that
    the great apps are yet to arrive and may come after iPad 2.0 (with retina display
    and 2 cameras comes out). \r\n\r\nYou must have not tried Osfoora for twitter
    or Reeder for RSS (btw, you can tweet from Reeder within the app. I use that feature
    frequently.) Both are nice apps that have a lot of features that you might have
    liked.  \r\n\r\nAlso, you can not only highlight with the Kindle app, you can
    also dogear pages (without fearing castration). Also, I love GoodReader for PDF
    books which are becoming more common. I haven't warmed up to iBooks yet.\r\n\r\nIt
    all boils down to the individual I guess. I guess I must be the iPad's target
    market."

  content: "@Jim: Nice one, it is good to hear both points of view. \r\niPad apps
    don't really suck, that's a bit over the top. They just don't make me think 'wow'.
    \r\n\r\nThe app store frustrates me a lot. Takes a while to load. When it does
    load, I want to see the top apps (which actually rarely change). I'll want to
    load more to see more top apps, so will tap a few times to load 25 more. After
    clicking through to read about that app, then clicking back, you have to 'load
    more' again to get back to where you were. When you install an app, the app store
    closes (same on iPhone actually) which means having to reopen it and start all
    over again. Just isn't that slick.\r\n\r\nWould like to see trial versions of
    apps (not just lite versions) before buying them, just like Mac Apps, so you can
    try them before forking out the money for them.\r\n\r\nBut it is early days, I'm
    sure there are a lot more to come."

    I always try the Lite version first when possible. I usually base my purchases

    business sense, as that require decent productivity apps that havnt really appeared
    yet (but which will come I'm sure).\r\n\r\nHowever, I find it hard to beat coming
    home knackered after work, and rather than sitting down at ANOTHER desk to spend
    my evening, lying back on the couch or bed and browsing/watching/reading/playing
    something.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the main sticking point at the minute is the price,
    which will come down, but I do think that multitouch interfaces are the way forward
    for 90% of the things we currently use our computers for (not to mention the things
    we havnt yet thought of). In comparison to multitouch, using a mouse is like using
    a stick to play a piano. Once theUI puzzles are solved, and there's a multitouch
    version of Photoshop/InDesign/Etc (or whatever they're called, I actually don't
    think Adobe are nimble enough to be the ones to make this happen), I dot think
    we'll look back."

    drives and a Wacom tablet hooked in and it needs near constant power to live.
    My iPad is unencumbered. I can pick it up and run to a meeting and not worry about
    bringing a power charger with me. With my stylus, I jot down notes in Penultimate,
    sketch with ArtStudio. I'll use Reeder or Flipboard or Twittelator to browse RSS
    and Twitter because they present this information in the best possible way. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    your note about not being able to share directly to Twitter from an RSS reader
    is wrong. Reeder and Flipboard do this very well."

  content: "iPad is like Italian sports cars, they look marvelous but are not practical
    for daily use. Sure they turn heads but when you have to take it to the mechanic
    every week, it really becomes a pain in the butt, and you wish you didn't get
    it in the first place. Same thing happened to me when I got the ipad. it was highly
    recommended by two (executive-type) friends and i quickly ran my fingers on the
    screen and it looked nice, so i decided i'd like one too. I am neither what's
    referred to as an \"Apple fan boy\" nor an \"Apple hater\", so my opinion is purely
    objective coming from someone who believes technology should be used for human
    increased efficiency and pleasure. \r\n\r\nI can summarize the snags as I encountered
    them: first off i bought it just before a long 10-hour flight to kill time, only
    it won't start because it needs activation. why? what if i don't have a PC to
    activate so you need a pc to start using it, which means right there it cannot
    be a pc, you need a pc next to it. \r\n\r\nnext i play online fake money poker,
    but i could not download the software, because ipad does not allow it. why? then
    i wanted to reserve a car from a well known car rental company, but i could not
    reserve the car because their website uses flash (and ended up paying more for
    the car because reservation online is cheaper than showing up at their offices).
    \r\n\r\nnext I wanted to send an email with an attachment, but i cannot upload
    an attachment because i simply could not move my files to it. \r\n\r\nthen I wanted
    to load my songs, I had to download itunes then move my library to it, and from
    there to sync to ipad (the ipad player is really nice btw). \r\n\r\nthen i needed
    to move my pictures and that was a hassle too. \r\n\r\nfor web browsing i use
    Firefox for multi tab, but ipad won't allow me to download it. why? i must use
    the extremely limited features Safari. why is that? I am not betraying Apple by
    using firefox. \r\n\r\nby now I started feeling cheated especially as I paid a
    lot of money for it because i got it from outside the US. i thought fine I am
    sure my wife would love it (all wives like expensive and flashy stuff), but she
    too ended up leaving it on the side, and using our old laptop (she says she felt
    frustrated by the ipad but was unable to tell me why exactly). \r\n\r\nthen i
    thought let me at least let my 1 year old daughter play with it, but she was not
    enthused either (she was unable to tell me why either). on top of all of this,
    I need a pc to use the ipad, so the assumption is i have a pc, which makes it
    a \"third class citizen\". \r\n\r\nthe ipad is too small to use efficiently but
    too big to carry around as a personal organizer, I also did not know how to hold
    it ... it is always feels like it's about to slip, putting it on a table reduces
    the wi-fi signal, while holding it after 10 minutes becomes hard, on my next trip,
    i doubt that i will take it as i cannot guarantee that i won't need a usb port,
    or flash, or to download or upload, so it's not a trusted friend, i will stick
    to my 3 year old laptop. \r\n\r\ni am writing all of this on my laptop, i won't
    dream of using the ipad for writing this long letter. I read what people say about
    \"oh it's for consumption of data not creating it\". What a lame excuse. How can
    you separate the two? I am not a graphic designer so I know already that I won't
    be creating logos in my spare time on it. But you cannot separate one from the
    other, for example you get an email from a colleague or a friend asking you to
    send them a file or a presentation or a picture. In order to answer him you need
    to \"attach\" those files but those files cannot reside in the iPad, nor can you
    access a flash memory. This is data creation because by definition it can't be
    consumption. So this email cannot be answered on the spot, you need a \"real\"
    pc for that. Most of my emails contain an attachment. If i needed to send a passing
    note to anyone I can send an SMS I don't an iPad.\r\n\r\nhaving said all of the
    above, i thought I don't mind paying a lot for something if it pleases me, but
    the ipad is not that, it's not a pc nor a laptop, not a phone nor a electronic
    organizer, not a camera not an mp3 player, it's not a tv nor a media center (does
    not read flash memory), it's not an internet browser because I am not a kid who
    needs to start from the beginning every time i close safari to use the calculator.
    I finally reached the conclusion that the ipad is a lot of wasted energy and effort
    and R&amp;D by Apple in a nice package. today I sold it to my friend for 25% less
    than what i bought it for, but I am relieved. and i will never buy a \"closed\"
    system ever again. One last note, judging by how strongly owners of iPad reply
    to my bashing it tells me they hate it too, but they suffer from that psychological
    phenomenon in humans that \"justify the decision after it's made even if utterly
    wrong\"."

  content: "I sold one also and I bought mine Lee!!!!\r\n\r\nMy ten year old son thought
    it was magic, he loved laying with the games and apps. I think there's a bit of
    insight in there somewhere but I also think it was a bit extravagant to gift to
    my kid.  Instead, Santa's gonna bring him an iPod Touch.\r\n\r\nFor anyone in
    the industry, it would make much more sense to buy a decent laptop or save the
    money towards something bigger. If you are already 'kitted out', I'd recommend
    satisfying your gadget fix with a Kindle and spend the change on a relaxing weekend
    away to read the thing."

Back in June I had the pleasure of winning an iPad from the <a href="http://onotate.com/">Onotate team</a>. Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely thankful but <strong>after less than 2 months of very little usage I've sold it</strong>. Why did it fail me?

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ipad.jpg" alt="ipad.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="159" /></div>

<h4>There's no use case</h4>

I have no use for the iPad. So many times <strong>I've "tried to fit it into my life"</strong> but it never really caught on.

A <strong>£400/£500 gadget shouldn't be something you <em>try</em> to fit into your life</strong>. It should just fit. When I bought my first MacBook Pro a couple years back, it fitted perfectly. When I purchased an iPhone, it fitted perfectly. These things allowed me to be more efficient and productive. The iPad doesn't do that.

I've struggled to find a use case for it. <strong>The best I've found is reading the Sun in bed when I wake up in the morning.</strong> That's a damn expensive newspaper, considering you still have to pay a monthly subscription for the newspaper on top of the initial app purchase.

I've also tried browsing the web while in front of the TV, but again I rely to much on my "work environment". As a web designer I'm never just browsing, I'm usually doing some sort of work on the computer that involves a host of other apps.

<h4>iPad apps suck</h4>

I have yet to discover an iPad app that 'wows' me. Yes there are lots of beautifully designed apps from a lot of talented developers but nothing has stuck out as a 'must have'.

If you ask someone with an iPad to recommend some apps, you'll generally get a response that includes the following.

<h5>File sharing apps</h5>
What's the deal with file sharing apps? <strong>Haven't we been sharing files easily for years?</strong> Why do we need an app to do this? I can just use my laptop to produce the files I need and remove the need to 'share' them or sync them from the iPad.

<h5>Reading apps</h5>
I tried to read books on the iPad. I have to admit it is a lot better than I thought it would be, but you still can't beat a physical book.

I prefer lifting a book, highlighting key lines with a highlighter, bending a page corner and setting that beside my bed as a reminder to read it. A digital book doesn't replace that.

<h5>RSS readers</h5>
When it comes to reading RSS feeds, if I come across a useful article I'll tag in on delicious. If it's really useful, I'll share it on Twitter, or I'll open up TextMate or Photoshop to make something. <strong>I can do these things no problem on the MacBook Pro but on the iPad it can't be done</strong> or in the case of sharing on Twitter, it involves opening and closing apps.

<h4>Why is it so successful?</h4>

The iPad failed for me but it certainly hasn't seemed to have failed Apple.

<blockquote>Apple indicates that it has sold 3.27 million iPads as of June 26. That translates to more than $2 billion in revenue for the company in a product category that didn’t even exist one year ago.</blockquote>

The above is a recent extract from <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/07/20/ipad-revenue/">Mashable</a>.

A few good use cases or suitable personas I can think of include:

<ul>
<li><strong>People who travel a lot</strong> - it's lighter than a laptop, has longer battery life, so is useful for email management and web browsing if traveling regularly</li>
<li><strong>Sales people</strong> - if you go out to pitch to potential customers regularly or give one to one presentations on a regular basis it is quite useful</li>
</ul>

<h4>Is it a fail in the long run?</h4>
Apple have introduced this new product to the market, and <strong>being the first company to do so has contributed to its success.</strong> It's a new toy, a new era, so people are jumping on board and trying to justify its existence.

One year from now we'll surely see a certain 'type' of person who relies heavily on the iPad, but right now I'm not sure who that will be.

For me, I'd prefer to sell the iPad (which I have done) and upgrade to an iPhone 4 (which I plan on doing).
