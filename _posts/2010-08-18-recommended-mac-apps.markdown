  content: "I love using Mailplane too - it really does make Gmail so much better
    to use. I have never used MacJournal so might check that out.\r\n\r\nDoes LittleSnapper
    capture full web pages including the typekit fonts that are embedded? Some of
    the screen capture apps I tried before were ignoring the typekit fonts, which
    was a bit frustrating.\r\n\r\nHave you ever used PathFinder? http://cocoatech.com/\r\nI
    simply couldn't use my Mac now without it. It really does pimp out your Finder
    window and lets you work faster on multiple projects shifting easily through directories.
    Being able to have \"tabs\" open in your finder is so useful when you are moving
    files around. If you haven't used it before, check it out... would definitely
    be useful for you."

    not the most feature intensive app in the world and there are others about that

  content: "I've started to use Evernote (http://www.evernote.com/) a lot as it can
    keep all notes on my Mac, iPhone and iPad in sync, I find it a lot easier to use
    it for quick notes than TextEdit where I have to go through the process of saving
    the note and having to actually share it with my other devices instead of it going
    automatically.\r\n\r\nI've also started using ExpanDrive (http://www.expandrive.com/mac),
    an awesome Mac (maybe Windows too) app that allows you to connect to an FTP, SFTP,
    Amazon and something else. But it allows you to access those files through Finder
    like you would if they were on your hard drive. I use it for connecting to the
    development server in work so I can work straight on there instead of saving the
    file then transferring it over. Really speeds up development time."

  content: "I use the majority of those apps myself. I tend to prefer Thoughts (http://www.thoughtsapp.com/)
    to MacJournal and Nambu (http://nambu.com/) to Tweetdeck, though it doesn't have
    the same functionality.\r\n\r\nI'm also a big fan of Alfred (http://www.alfredapp.com/)
    as Simon pointed out above, as well as LESS.app (http://incident57.com/less/)
    which I have found to really speed up my CSS coding when used correctly."

  content: I've never really gotten used to TweetDeck funnily enough, eventually I
    just got back to using Tweetie more again, TweetDeck seems a bit too complicated
    or their interface is too 'busy' lets just say.

  content: I used to use TweetDeck but then switched to HootSuite. The main benefit
    is it indicates where you last looked at your feeds, so all the new tweets/posts
    are clearly highlighted. It's also accessed via the browser so you can login from
    any computer.

Nearly two years ago I published a post on <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/15-mac-apps-web-designers-should-have-in-their-dock/">15 mac apps web designers should have in their dock</a>. 

I thought it was about time I updated this list with any new apps I've started using but turns out I've been using pretty much the same lot since then.

Here are 5 new apps I've been introduced to during that time and now use daily.

<!--more-->

<h4><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/chrome">1. Google Chrome</a></h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/chrome"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/chrome.gif" alt="chrome.gif" border="0" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>

Firefox was once my choice but for some reason it started running very slow for me. I'd especially find YouTube videos very jumpy. So one day I tried out Chrome and absolutely loved it. It's light weight, fast and trim.

After I sourced a few extensions I use often (namely <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/lnejbeiilmbliffhdepeobjemekgdnok">Delicious</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka">EyeDropper</a>) I fully switched over my default browser.

Chrome also renders with the WebKit engine so <strong>you get all the nice CSS3 and HTML5 goodies</strong> (that also come with Safari).

I still tend to keep Firefox open though. <strong>It's hard to beat that Developer Toolbar and Firebug.</strong> I also prefer the autocomplete that comes with the Firefox web address bar.

If you're asking "What about Safari?" I never really got using it - an earlier version used to crash on me quite a lot which put me off it.

<h4><a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/">2. Mailplane</a></h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/mailplane.gif" alt="mailplane.gif" border="0" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>

Only started using this recently for managing emails. I have 4 different GMail accounts for different domains that I was continually checking and had tabs open in the browser for (I wanted to keep them separate).

Mailplane is a desktop app but with the same look and feel and interaction as GMail has in the browser. <strong>It has some niceties like a top toolbar and 'neater' switching between accounts.</strong>

<h4><a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">3. TweetDeck</a></h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/tweetdeck.gif" alt="tweetdeck.gif" border="0" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>

This is my Twitter client of choice. Some people really dislike it, and to be honest it doesn't scream of the typical nice UI you get with Mac apps, but <strong>I find it really handy for keeping track of multiple accounts and groups of people</strong>.

Also nice integration with other social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, even FourSquare.

<h4><a href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/products/macjournal/">4. MacJournal</a></h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/products/macjournal/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/macjournal.gif" alt="macjournal.gif" border="0" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>

MacJournal actually came part of a <a href="http://www.macheist.com/">MacHeist</a> bundle and I find it really useful for taking daily notes. I now use it to keep track of:

<ul>
<li>Meetings (what was discussed)</li>
<li>Events (what was talked about)</li>
<li>Books (overviews and key notes)</li>
<li>Workshops (what I learned)</li>
</ul>

Great for referring back to. In the past I would have recorded these things in a notebook, which would eventually be lost, forgot about or binned.

<h4><a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/">5. LittleSnapper</a></h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/littlesnapper.gif" alt="littlesnapper.gif" border="0" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>

LittleSnapper was also part of a MacHeist bundle. <strong>Useful for taking screenshots of web pages and nice graphics then keeping them to hand for inspiration.</strong>

I wish I could say I had a really neat and nicely configured LittleSnapper for all areas of inspiration but I never get around to organising it (except once when I did it on a plane).

<h4>What would you recommend?</h4>

I'm sure there are tonnes of apps out there that I haven't tried and should be using.

<strong><em>If you were to recommend one really good app that I haven't mentioned, what would it be?</em></strong>
