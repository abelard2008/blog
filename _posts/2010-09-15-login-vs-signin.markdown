    from Lee Munroe.\"\r\nReading with love too.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS : Maybe the \"Notify
    me followup comments\" should not be on by default, don't know just an idea, I
    thought it was the \"I aggre to the long rules nobody reads\"."

    it matters. As long as it's clear and not hidden!"

  content: Personally I prefer "Sign In". But it really depends on the application.  I
    have a gripe at the terminology used when it comes to "Login", I feel it should
    say "Log In" because to me the latter is a call to action where as "Login" is
    more of an entity or an object (Login Details) that users would store or use.

  content: "I would be inclined to use 'Login' or 'Log In' personally. However, when
    thinking about the theory of it, 'Sign In' could be easily paired with 'Register'
    rather than 'Sign Up' to make sure users don't click the wrong link by mistake.\r\n\r\nLike
    many things, I think it just comes down to personal preference or whichever term
    suits the audience best - I'd have to agree that 'Login' is more suited to the
    'techy people'."

    login forms is to find ‘Sign In’ and ‘Sign Up’ together. It's even worse when

    prefer to use ‘Login’ and ‘Sign Up’."

  content: "All good feedback. Looks like a matter of preference really. Be interesting
    to see A/B test results from someone like Google.\r\n\r\nOne issue that crops
    up is that \"Login\" isn't a verb, so it should be \"Log in\".\r\nAlthough this
    is true, do links have to be labelled with verbs? e.g. I know \"Home\" will bring
    me to the homepage but that doesn't mean I'll label it \"Visit the homepage\"\r\n\r\nWhat
    if you thought about it in a way that 'login' brings you to a login screen/page,
    which is where you 'log in'?\r\n\r\n@cmckelvey: Register vs Sign up - that can
    be the next debate ;-)\r\n\r\n@Alan in Belfast: These are from http://www.reinvigorate.net
    (fantastic product). http://www.crazyegg.com/ also very useful\r\n\r\n@Elisabeth
    Irgens: Agreed, that is a really nice way of logging in and signing up."

    the \"Don't Make Me Think\" logic, perhaps placement is more important than terminology.
    \ I always look for a login link in the same place, but I don't really care what
    you call it."

    long as people understand both terms, then there's no point in navel-gazing about
    which to use. This is an issue to examine purely in the light of copy style."

    fields + a "Join / Sign Up / Register" link below.

If you develop web apps or design web app interfaces there is one link you will inevitably always have. This link allows the user to log in, or sign in, to the website. But <strong>what is the correct terminology to use?</strong>

<!--more-->

<h4>A look at the big sites</h4>

Let's look at the web's top web sites and applications to see what terminology they use.

<h4>Definitions</h4>

Looking at other websites there <strong>doesn't seem to be anything decisive</strong> - there's a mix of login, sign in and log in.

What does each term mean?

<strong>Definition of login (from <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/login">Dictionary.com</a>)</strong>

<blockquote>the act of logging in to a computer, esp. a multiuser computer or a remote or networked computer system</blockquote>

<strong>Definition of sign in (from <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sign+in">Dictionary.com</a>)</strong>

<blockquote>an act, an instance, or a time of signing in</blockquote>

No conclusive answer here either, both work fine.

<h4>How I work</h4>

I use <strong>login</strong>.

The reason for this is because <strong>I tend to keep sign up and login links available at all times</strong>, on all pages. These links are usually top right and <strong>next to each other</strong> e.g. <a href="http://lookaly.com/">Lookaly.com</a>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://lookaly.com/"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/look_head1.jpg" alt="look_head.jpg" border="0" /></a></div>

Here's a heatmap visual of this area.

Using the term 'login' means that <strong>at a glance the user can instantly tell the difference between 'Login' and 'Sign up'</strong>.

By using 'Sign in' the <strong>user has to take a second or two to read the words to identify between the two</strong> and there's more chance of them clicking the wrong link.

Of course this theory only comes into effect if you have a sign up and login link beside one another. As you can also see from the heatmap above, this sign up link doesn't get a lot of clicks and most of the sign ups come from other call-to-actions throughout the site.
