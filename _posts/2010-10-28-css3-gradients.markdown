  content: "Handy article there Lee for anyone looking to get into some CSS3. I haven't
    used CSS3 Gradients much yet, but I have been using quite a bit of the other CSS3
    properties, like RGBa etc.\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer may eventually catch up, but
    like you said there... that's why we have the fallback properties in there. :-)"

    tool!!! The only thing I'm worried about is that I'll use it so much it becomes
    a crutch and keeps me from completely mastering the code itself. I guess there
    are worse things to worry about. :-)"

  content: Good article, but remember to put the actual css3 property last (that is,
    after the vendor prefixed ones). That way, when these browsers begin to support
    the proper syntax they will use these instead of the experimental vendor prefix
    ones.

    in the coming future if they want to stay back in the race.

  content: I have come to accept that Microsoft and the Internet Explorer browser
    was sent from hell by the devil himself to slowly erode the creative spirit of
    web developers everywhere. I tried using a gradient for my nav, but of course
    I had to have an IE version, and by that point I was just adding another http
    request, which completely defeated the purpose of using the gradient.

  content: I've been planning on writing a gradient generator myself (as close to
    Photoshop's gradient editor as possible, but with a few minor additions). The
    fact that gradients are heavily visual in nature means you can't simply sit down
    and write out the code whilst having a solid idea of what it'll look like... you
    need constant feedback to get that right look. That's why editors are needed (though
    of course, it never hurts to know the syntax behind it, either. ;))

    This works on IE, search on the internet to pie.php. This can you put in your CSS file and it works!

CSS3 gradients are available to use in Webkit (Safari, Chrome) and Mozilla (Firefox) browsers. They're not exactly new but I only recently started using them consistently myself so I've put together this quick article.

<!--more-->

FYI this isn't the holy grail of CSS3 gradients, it's more of a reminder for me or quick getting started guide.

<h4>Why use CSS3 gradients instead of images?</h4>

<ol>
<li>Gives you more flexibility</li>
<li>Less hassle</li>
<li>Fewer http requests</li>
<li>Scalable</li>
</ol>

<h4>The syntax</h4>

<h5>W3C</h5>
<pre><code>
linear-gradient( [<point> || <angle>,]? <stop>, <stop> [, <stop>]* )

radial-gradient( [<position> || <angle>,]? [<shape> || <size>,]? <stop>, <stop>[, <stop>]* )
</code></pre>

<h5>Mozilla (Firefox)</h5>
Same as W3C (but with -moz-)
<pre><code>
-moz-linear-gradient( [<point> || <angle>,]? <stop>, <stop> [, <stop>]* )

-moz-radial-gradient( [<position> || <angle>,]? [<shape> || <size>,]? <stop>, <stop>[, <stop>]* )
</code></pre>
<h5>WebKit (Safari, Chrome)</h5>
Bit different.
<pre><code>
-webkit-gradient(<type>, <point> [, <radius>]?, <point> [, <radius>]? [, <stop>]*)
</code></pre>

Confused yet? Instead of trying to explain what everything means I'm just going to show you some <strong><em>very simple</em></strong> examples.

<h4>CSS3 gradient examples</h4>

<h5>Linear background gradient</h5>

<pre><code>
html{
  height:100%;
}
body{
  background-color:#440951;
  background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #b032cb, #440951);
  background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top,left bottom, from(#b032cb), to(#440951));
  background-image: linear-gradient(top, #b032cb, #440951);
}
</code></pre>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://leemunroe.com/css3/linear.html"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/linear.jpg" alt="linear.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="190" /></a></div>

<a href="http://leemunroe.com/css3/linear.html">Demo</a>

<h5>Radial background gradient</h5>

<pre><code>
html{
  height:100%;
}
body{
  background-color:#440951;
  background-image: -moz-radial-gradient(center 45deg,circle cover, #b032cb, #440951);
  background-image: -webkit-gradient(radial, 50% 50%, 0, 50% 50%,800, from(#b032cb), to(#440951));
  background-image: radial-gradient(center 45deg,circle cover, #b032cb, #440951);
}
</code></pre>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://leemunroe.com/css3/radial.html"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/radial.jpg" alt="radial.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="180" /></a></div>

<a href="http://leemunroe.com/css3/radial.html">Demo</a>

<h5>Body background height problem</h5>

Seems that gradients don't stretch the whole height of the browser window unless you declare the html height. Therefore this is needed:

<pre><code>html{height:100%}</code></pre>

<h4>But it doesn't work in Internet Explorer!</h4>

That's why we have a fall back value in for the background-color <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">which should be enough</a> although you can always use an image if you like.
