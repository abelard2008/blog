In 2010 Cardpay approached me looking for a more usable and more trustworthy website. Being an online payment processing provider, security, trustworthiness and usability were very important to them.

My role involved researching existing payment providers, putting together a better user flow than what existed currently then adding a usable and trustworthy design on top of that, that merchants were able to use with ease.
