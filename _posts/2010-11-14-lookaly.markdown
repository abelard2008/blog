While completing a Masters I setup Lookaly as a joint venture with local developer James Gallagher.

Lookaly helps you find the best places and services in Northern Ireland, based on reviews from others. It also helps small businesses manage their online presence and reputation.

My role with Lookaly includes managing all areas of design, brand direction, business strategy and the obligatory admin that comes with running a business.

In 2010 Lookaly released an iPhone app. I designed the app and Ecliptic Labs did an awesome job of developing the app and integrating my designs.
