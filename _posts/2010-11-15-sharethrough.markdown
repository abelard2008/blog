In 2009 I started working for Sharethrough as their UX Designer. My role since has involved ensuring their website, platform, blog, video units and all products look good, perform well and are easy to use.

My role with Sharethrough involves providing concepts, designs and HTML/CSS solutions for their team of developers and working closely with the marketing team to ensure the right message is delivered to customers.

Based in San Francisco, Sharethrough are the leaders in social video marketing with clients such as Sony, Xbox and Pepsi. They recently secured a $5 million investment in a recent funding round.
