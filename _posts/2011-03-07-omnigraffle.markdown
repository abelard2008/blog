<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">Omnigraffle</a> is a Mac application that I've heard other designers mention but have never tried myself. Recently I decided to take the plunge and see what all the fuss was about.

<strong>In the end, I loved it, and ended up buying it. Here's why.</strong>

<!--more-->

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/omni.gif" alt="omni.gif" border="0" width="128" height="128" /></div>

<blockquote>OmniGraffle is a comprehensive, yet easy to use diagramming and drawing application. Drag and drop to create wireframes, flow charts, network diagrams, UI mockups, family trees, office layouts, and more. </blockquote>

<h4>It's a great tool to take your sketches to digital</h4>

I have lots of <strong>A3 sketches, wireframes and diagrams</strong> on my desk. These all make sense to me, the problem is they don't make sense to other project team members or clients, nor are they easy to share or distribute, so at some point I have to transfer these to digital format.

In the past I would use something like Illustrator (or <a href="http://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> for quick wireframing), but Illustrator wasn't really made for this.

<strong>Omnigraffle is the perfect solution</strong>. It is the digital equivalent of an A3 sheet of paper and sharpie market.

<h4>Information architecture</h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ia1.jpg" alt="ia.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="400" /></div>

<strong>Simple shapes and ease of taking notes</strong>. Similar to Keynote or Powerpoint but a lot more flexible and more control over how you structure your layout.

<h4>Sitemaps</h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/sitemap.jpg" alt="sitemap.jpg" border="0" width="540" height="401" /></div>

Ease of creating and <strong>managing sitemaps</strong> (so so easy).

<h4>Wireframes</h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/wire3.jpg" alt="" title="wire" width="528" height="447" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2281" /></div>

Lots of <strong>reusable elements for creating wireframes </strong>for websites and applications.

Check out these templates and stencils:

<h4>Well recommended</h4>

I didn't go into much detail here but if you're a UX Designer, or involved with this early stage design process, I definitely recommend you try out <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">Omnigraffle</a> (free 14-day trial).

Check out these <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/videos/">short video tutorials</a> for how to get started.
