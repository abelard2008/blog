I had the pleasure of spending <strong>March 11th-15th in Austin, Texas for SXSW Interactive</strong>, (possibly/probably) the world's largest gathering of geeks, techies, designers, developers, startups, CEOs, investors and "social media gurus".

I'm sure you were bombarded with #sxsw tweets and Gowalla checkins to various parties so here's an overview of what it's all about.

<!--more-->

<h3>Talks/Panels</h3>
I don't have an exact figure but there must have been at least <strong>500 or so talks</strong> over the course of SXSWi.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2292" title="talk" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/talk.jpg" alt="Talks" width="500" height="374" /></p>
It's very <strong>overwhelming and hard to get a plan together</strong>. So many good topics and speakers all happening at once so you have to take a risk and choose one over the others.

On top of that you're <strong>meeting people and socialising</strong> outside the talks.

I attended quite a few UX and design talks but the problem with this is <strong>you end up hearing about things you already know or have read about</strong> elsewhere. The better talks are about <strong>things you have an interest in but that wouldn't be your main domain</strong>.

My favourite talks:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-4-pirates-20-march-2011-sxsw">Startup Metrics for Pirates</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bokardo/metricsdriven-design-4317168">Metrics Driven Design</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIwzbZq5uyY">Google's Marissa Mayer Presents</a></li>
</ul>
I've still to hear the keynotes though, which I've heard good reports about.
<h3><del>Networking</del> Socialising</h3>
Plenty of opportunities to meet and greet people at SXSW. As most people at the Conference Center are either in a talk or on their way to a talk, <strong>the best place to socialise is at a bar or a coffee shop</strong> (depending on the time of day).
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2291" title="cards" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/cards.jpg" alt="Cards" width="500" height="373" /></p>
Everybody at SXSW is looking to meet people so the best thing to do is just go up to someone, introduce yourself and ask "<strong>So what do you do?</strong>".
<h3>Parties</h3>
I heard this quote mentioned a few times:
<blockquote>SXSWi is 40% business and 60% parties</blockquote>
<em>â€”Anonymous</em>

Every night there are a tonne of parties hosted by the likes of <strong>Mashable, Gowalla, Foursquare, Vimeo, YouTube, Media Temple, MMXINI</strong> that are attended by everyone in the industry (plus the occasional <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/aplusk/status/46792237379616768">celebrity</a>).

The <strong>parties are definitely the best places to meet people</strong> and if there's someone you really want to say hello to you can usually stalk them on Gowalla or Twitter.

The <a href="http://gowalla.com/spots/9225">Ginger Man</a> was a local favourite for meeting up with designers and developers. And I was able to meet up with a client, <a href="http://sharethrough.com/">Sharethrough</a>, at the Say Media party, which was the first face to face meeting we'd had in 18 months.
<h3>Travel advice</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Get a US sim card - try <a href="http://www.uk2abroad.com/default.aspx">UK2Abroad</a> $1.50 per day for unlimited data</li>
	<li>If staying in a hotel outside downtown, make sure it's on the shuttle route</li>

<h3>Thanks to Invest NI</h3>
Big thanks to <a href="http://www.investni.gov.uk/">Invest NI</a> who sponsored 25 interactive companies from Northern Ireland to attend the conference in Austin, alongside <a href="http://digitalcircle.org/">Digital Circle</a> and <a href="http://digitalderry.org/">Digital Derry</a>.

Special thanks to <strong>Terry Reilly</strong> who helps us plan the trip and keeps us right when we're over there.

And <strong>thanks to the NI delegates who made it a great experience. </strong>
<h3>Would I recommend it?</h3>
Absolutely.

I was able to meet lots of cool people, learn lots of stuff, make some connections, get some work, and come home fully charged and inspired.
