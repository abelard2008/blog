  content: "Good shout about the buzzword context. I've noticed this as well, especially
    in the recent run ups of the IMD degree's Vivas. \"Technologies used HTML5, CSS3
    etc,etc\". I know it is a small issue compared to saying \"HTML and CSS\". But
    the general atmosphere I got from those presentations was, if they did not mention
    the latest of the latest/buzzy terms, they'd get marked down or secretly mocked
    for living in the past. As you know the lecturers very well Lee, you'll know how
    much they love the latest stable standards. I would say students giving those
    presentations though, if they just mentioned 'HTML', the audience would not have
    figured HTML5 would be in there, because it is constantly being separated as this
    untouchable concept driving us into the future.\r\n\r\nPerhaps with time that
    would change. Hopefully.\r\n\r\nWith recent projects I find myself at Level 5,
    doing a lot of work with the canvas api especially.\r\n\r\nDavid Turner wrote
    an interesting piece of buzzwords in our industry a while back, http://uni.davidturner.name/511/08.2.-Lost-in-Translation/
    , a good read."

  content: "I use a lot of the newer HTML5 stuff in the work that I do. Much like
    yourself I've mainly been using the new semantic tags for layout and form elements..
    though I tend to avoid the search input, I dislike the lack of control I have
    in terms of layout.\r\n\r\nI do play around with HTML5 video, but only in my own
    personal projects at this point. I've seen too many smaller sites crash because
    their videos became a big hit and their bandwidth allowance got chewed up in the
    process. Even when I do use it, because I have to provide an mp4 file (for apple
    and some android devices) I am also able to provide a flash based alternative
    for our good friend Internet explorer (6-8).\r\n\r\nI've not really looked too
    much into the more cutting edge technologies involved with HTML5, though the potential
    for offline storage in one of my current projects means I'll definitely be looking
    into what these new technologies bring to the table.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already
    looked into it, I'd also consider looking into modernizr (http://www.modernizr.com/)
    as a potential replacement for the common HTML5 shiv. All the fixes that the shiv
    provides plus it checks browser support for a wealth of different things, which
    can be useful in certain instances for styling around some issues with browsers
    that don't support things fully."

  content: "In contravention of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_Law_of_Headlines\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Betteridge's Law</a> I am happy to answer yes to the title of
    this post.\r\n\r\nI've used something from each of the levels, and wouldn't consider
    building a site without the new structural elements. The level of semantics they
    provide is way above anything in 4.01 and using them really makes you think about
    the structure of documents. The IE without JS issue is a non-issue if you are
    cool with a stylesheet link inside a noscript inside a conditional comment, so
    they are totally safe.\r\n\r\nI agree with Chris that the buzzword issue is worth
    a mention. I think it will take a long time to die down simply because it is being
    used by clients, marketing departments and journalists who don't really know (or
    haven't a clue) what it means.\r\n\r\nI still hear the odd mention of Web 2.0
    and that's going back a good few years, so although HTML5 has a narrow definition
    in our community it can mean 'new and shiny with animations' to others.\r\n\r\nRelated:
    I recently gave a short presentation on general web matters and was asked afterwards
    if the Google balls were done in JavaScript 5.\r\n\r\nOn the flipside though,
    I don't think it's worth getting too hung up on a strict definition. Geolocation
    for example is no longer part of HTML5 (it's got its own spec) but you will find
    it in a lot of HTML5 books, websites and tutorials. Similarly the localStorage
    API is not accessed using hypertext markup language of any version."

    Ha, had never seen Betteridge's Law before. Like \"Web 2.0\" I'm sure clients
    will start using the \"HTML5\" term long after we're done using, or when it's
    \"not cool\" to use it anymore."

  content: "Hello guys we have been using HTML5 for around 6 months now although we
    have built all our 1200 sites to pass most w3c markups sometimes we use expression
    web and build sites that pass everything really depends on what the client wants.\r\n\r\nAs
    w3c coders, we also run the w3cforum.com with permission (its really just a site
    for free promotion a bit like w3c sites)we think it will catch on because certain
    software would never validate before no matter what you did to the HTML.\r\n\r\nOne
    really good aspect of running HTML5 is if you validate the the HTML part your
    page will always also pass section 508 so may be its best selling point when the
    federal government gets really tough with non-validated websites in America!"

HTML5 is quite the buzzword at the minute. A lot of designers and front-end developers will now say <strong>"I use HTML5 and CSS3"</strong> rather than just good olde "HTML and CSS" (I'm one of them, depending on the context). 

At some point the HTML5 fad will die and <strong>we'll go back to saying HTML</strong> (did you ever say you used HTML 4.01?) but until then we'll throw the HTML5 buzz word around a bit more.

<strong>But what does it actually mean to say you use HTML5?</strong>

<!--more-->

I see HTML5 being broken down into 5 different levels.

<h4>1. Doctype</h4>
Technically if you use an <strong>HTML5 doctype declaration</strong>, you're using HTML5.

Along with your doctype you can <strong>tidy up the rest of your head</strong> like so.

<pre><code>
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
...
</code></pre>

This is simple stuff, and you usually have this <strong>saved in some sort of template</strong>.

<h4>2. Forms</h4>
The next level of HTML5 is adding some niceness to forms. 

<strong>Validation, place holders, calendars, input types</strong> can all be declared with HTML5 and in most cases all that is needed is dropping in an extra attribute to your already existent XHTML forms.

<pre><code>
<input type="search" id="keywords" name="keywords" placeholder="Search our site" autofocus>
</code></pre>

<h4>3. Layout and elements</h3>
We get a bit more advanced now with layout. HTML5 has introduced several new block elements for marking up your layout including <strong>header, footer, article, aside, section, figure</strong>.

<pre><code>
<header>
<h1>Heading goes here</h1>
</header>
<article>
<section>
<h2>Something in here</h2>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Something else in here</h2>
</section>
</article>
<aside>
<p>Something to accompany your article here</p>
</aside>
<footer>
<p>Copyright 2011</p>
</footer>
</code></pre>

For these new block elements to work across all browsers, <strong>make sure you declare them as block level elements and use the HTML shiv script for IE compatibility</strong>.

Include this in your head:
<pre><code>
<!--[if lt IE 9]> 
<script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"> </script> 
<![endif]-->
</code></pre>

And this in your stylesheet:
<pre><code>
header,footer,nav,article,aside,section,figure,figcaption,hgroup,audio,video{
display:block;
}
</code></pre>

<h4>4. Video and audio</h4>
There's a good chance most of you have looked at levels 1 to 3 as most projects require markup, layouts and forms but not all require video and audio.

<strong>No longer do you need to embed video and audio into Flash</strong>. They now have their own elements and controls you can customise in HTML5.

<pre><code>
<video src="video.mp4" controls width="640" height="360" poster="video.jpg"></video>
</code></pre>

<h4>5. Advanced features and Javascript</h4>

I've called level 5 advanced features as we're now diving into Javascript.

Most of the blog articles and books I've read on HTML5 cover the 4 levels above but brush over these advanced features, most likely because <strong>they deserve full books dedicated to the topic</strong> and are more developer than designer related.

These features include:
<ul>
<li>Canvas</li>
<li>Local/offline storage</li>
<li>Geolocation</li>
</ul>

<h4>How much HTML5 are you using?</h4>

To date I've only been using levels 1 to 3 myself. I've yet to have an excuse or reason to delve any further. 

<strong><em>Are you using HTML5? Have you looked at any of the advanced HTML5 features mentioned above?</em></strong>
