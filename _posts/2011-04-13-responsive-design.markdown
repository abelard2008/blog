  content: "Very interesting blog post Lee and very relevant to where I'm at with
    things. I've read countless posts on this over the past handful of weeks and the
    biggest argument against Responsive Design that comes up time and time again is
    the notion that this method doesn't really work for the portable web due to the
    fact that items are hidden rather and are still therefore downloaded. \r\n\r\nSeems
    to me that Responsive Web Design is linked only to the screen real estate rather
    than the available bandwidth and therefore isn't the best solution for mobile.
    Obviously if you are in an area with a 3G or WiFi connection this isn't an issue
    and RD really works.\r\n\r\nI think that to truly make it responsive there needs
    to be a server side function serving only the content relevant for the device.
    Unless you are willing to overlook the bandwidth issue I really see no other way
    round this.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  content: "Nice article Lee as always :)\r\n\r\n@Gareth yep, there certainly are
    bandwidth concerns when it comes to crafting a \"mobile friendly\" version of
    your site for mobile using media queries.\r\n\r\nMedia queries won't get you optimised
    media (images, video etc) for mobile, we need to serve smaller images, compressed
    media, whatever we can to reduce the hit on mobile users.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple
    of ways of doing this (http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/08/combining_media.html
    and http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_images_experimenting_with_context_aware_image_sizing/)
    not perfect, but it's good to see people are thinking about it.\r\n\r\nIn terms
    of hiding content, I'm trying to adopt Luke Wroblewski's approach of designing
    for mobile first so there is less junk to hide - http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933"

  content: "@Gareth: Great point, it certainly is linked to screen pixels available
    rather than device. Still a case for serving up mobile specific websites that
    use optimised assets. Some good links from Jordan.\r\n\r\n@Clark: Looking great!
    What's your experience selling this as a service to clients? You mentioned there
    is an iPad version planned - is this an extra service or included by default in
    the spec?\r\n\r\n@Jordan: The design for mobile first seems to be a good approach.
    Helps you sort out the important aspects and features of a website or web app.
    Nice links, thanks for sharing."

  content: "@Jordan I still haven't settled on a 'mobile strategy' yet but I am more
    and more moving towards the idea of designing for mobile first and then moving
    out from there. The concepts of responsive design still apply here and as Lee
    says it 'forces' your clients to think about what is most important in terms of
    content on the homepage. \r\n\r\nThis doesn't get round the issue of still serving
    hidden content to mobile devices. I guess until the @bandwith query is invented
    we're stuck with the 'separate site for separate devices' approach or the creativeness
    and inventiveness of others in our field. \r\n\r\nThanks for the links by the
    way. I think that I'll make these the last that I'm going to read on the subject
    and then I'm going to start putting some of the approaches into practise."

  content: "@Lee: Was very easy to sell a responsive design to this particular client
    as he is a massive \"technology whore\" who uses both an iPhone and iPad on a
    daily basis. His brief stated that he wanted a mobile version of the site however
    his attention was mostly focused on the iPhone. As the content was going to be
    the same on both desktop and mobile I suggested (and demonstrated) a responsive
    design which he preferred as it meant only having to update the content once for
    changes to appear across all devices but also gave the flexibility to tweek the
    layout for other devices such as the iPad.\r\n\r\nThe iPad version was covered
    in the original quotation but was delayed so we could focus on getting the desktop
    and mobile versions right in time before the launch date."

  content: "@Clark just going on what Lee said I was just wondering what the expectations
    of the client were? I know that we've talked about the fact that responsive sites
    still use the same bandwidth as desktop sites but I also know that I could sell
    a responsive site as a 'mobile' site because it 'looks' like a mobile site...
    even though you and I know that it really isn't a true mobile website.\r\n\r\nAs
    your client is a 'technology whore' I'm just curious as to his thoughts on his
    website responding to being displayed on the iPhone but not necessarily loading
    any faster. \r\n\r\nAlso I'm curious as to what you mean by 'only having to update
    the content once for changes to appear across all devices', surely even if you
    had two versions of the site (one for mobile and one for the desktop) you'd still
    only have to update the content once in the CMS?\r\n\r\nGreat comments by the
    way. Very interesting to see this being out to use in a real client relationship
    - hence my curiousity."

  content: "In theory responsive web design is a good idea but it has drawbacks. Not
    all layouts that work for a certain number of columns can be easily translated
    to less columns so on a case by case basis if you are doing a mobile version of
    an existing site you need to sign off all different views with the client.\r\n\r\nAlso
    what if you want to give your users a choice to view a particular version? E.g.
    viewing the desktop or multicolumn version of a site on a mobile device like iphone?\r\n\r\nAnd
    to reiterate what Gareth said what if you want the mobile version to serve up
    more summarized content e.g. just headlines of articles. \r\n\r\nThere doesn't
    seem to be a one-size-fits-all. Yet."

  content: "I have used some of the themify responsive themes, they are pretty cool.\r\n\r\nMore
    than media queries, you need to consider other elements of the site, like images
    file size, since most mobile networks are very slow, and limited on how much bytes
    you can use.\r\n\r\nI felt in love with media queries, but i think that a native
    mobile app does the job better most of the times....\r\n\r\nGreat site Lee"

More and more businesses, web apps and designers are offering up <strong>multiple versions of their websites</strong> depending on the <strong>device and resolution the user</strong> is using. Last week I did a bit of tweaking to my own website and one of the things I wanted to look at was <strong>responsive design</strong>. 

I simply wanted to <strong>offer an iPhone version of the website so iPhone users would see an iPhone friendly view</strong> of the website and blog articles, but using the same HTML/CSS and content (i.e. not serving up a separate mobile website). 

It's surprisingly simple.

<h4>What is responsive design?</h4>

<blockquote cite="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1258"><p>Responsive design allows you to fill in the blanks within devices classes through the application of fluid grids, flexible images, and (where possible) media queries.</p></blockquote>
&mdash; <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1258">Luke Wroblewski</a>

As Luke outlines above, it's about <strong>using up the space that is available, on the device the user is using</strong>, most effectively.

So a user using an iPad may be served a different view of the website as to that of a user using an iPhone (or desktop, or netbook or some super duper Nasa sized resolution).

<h4>Using CSS media queries</h4>

With a <strong>CSS media query we can target different screen resolutions</strong> with different styles.

Place this in your <strong>CSS</strong> stylesheet:

<pre><code>
@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
	/* Mobile styles go here */
	body{width:100%;}
	img{max-width:100%;}
}
</code></pre>

<em>The styles above are just examples. Remember to enter your own CSS.</em>

Then place this in your HTML <strong>header</strong> to ensure the iPhone doesn't automatically scale down the full page:

<pre><code>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
</code></pre>

Simples.

Things I changed for iPhone/smartphone view:
<ol>
<li><strong>Max-width</strong> of the overall container</li>
<li>Made the grid <strong>1 column</strong></li>
<li>Adjusted the <strong>font size</strong> for headings</li>
<li>Adjusted navigation positioning</li>
<li>Gave images a <strong>max-width</strong></li>
<li>Hid a couple of things that weren't important</li>
</ol>

And the result:

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/beforeafter.jpg" alt="beforeafter.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="510" /></div>
