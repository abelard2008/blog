  content: The main problem with HTML5, I believe, is that the tags have gone from
    too general in XHTML to too specific. Other than mainstream news media sites,
    I can't think of too many web sites I have worked on that I wished for an  tag,
    or  or . An appropriate block or inline element, such as  or , always worked just
    fine and could be identified with an appropriate id or class. And adding  and  for
    one particular implementation is rather short-sighted. What happens if Ruby falls
    out of favour and is replaced by something elseâ€¦ at least  and  have recognisable
    purposes, albeit deprecated ones.

  content: There is a bit of a large jump before your conclusion there... Sure this
    explains "header" and "footer", although these have been long-used terms for both
    online and print media. You do not explain the "section", "article" or "aside"
    tags, nor numerous others.

I had the pleasure of attending a talk by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CHRISDAVIDMILLS">Chris Mills</a>, creator of the <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/curriculum/">Opera Web Standards Curriculum</a>, which was organised by those <a href="http://webstandardistas.com/">Standardistas</a> fellas and <a href="http://2011.buildconf.com/">Build</a>. Chris was talking about HTML5 and one of the things I found interesting was the research behind how the HTML5 element names came about.
<!--more-->
<h4>Google research</h4>

Google looked at something like a billion web pages and measured what ID and class names were used the most.

The results looked like this:

<ol>
<li>footer</li>
<li>menu</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>small</li>
<li>text</li>
<li>content</li>
<li>header</li>
<li>nav</li>
<li>copyright</li>
<li>button</li>
</ol>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/google.gif" alt="google.gif" border="0" width="500" height="295" /></div>

<a href="http://code.google.com/webstats/2005-12/classes.html">See the full results here</a>.

Look familiar?

<h4>Opera research</h4>

Opera then conducted their own research too, which came up with similar results.

<h5>Classes</h5>

<ol>
<li>footer</li>
<li>menu</li>
<li>style1</li>
<li>msonormal</li>
<li>text</li>
</ol>

<a href="http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/572/classlist-url.htm">Full class results here</a>.

<h5>IDs</h5>

<ol>
<li>footer</li>
<li>content</li>
<li>header</li>
<li>logo</li>
<li>container</li>
</ol>

<a href="http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/572/idlist-url.htm">Full ID results here</a>.

<h4>And that's how HTML5 element names were decided</h4>

As you can see the new HTML5 element names were decided<strong> based on the most commonly used IDs and classes that web designers were already using</strong>.

Both 'main' and 'content' are the obvious omissions. I'm not 100% behind the reasoning for this but I guess 'section' and 'article' work better semantically for the main content areas.

Good to see 'msonormal' didn't creep in there.
