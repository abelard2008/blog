I worked closely with the CEO, Product Manager and Lead Developer to produce an aesthetically pleasing user interface for Kudyou.

Kudyou had a user experience designer and front end developer on board so my role was to interpret the UX design, make it look good, and deliver designs for the front end developer to work with.

What resulted was a series of high quality PSD templates and user interface elements that the developer could use.
