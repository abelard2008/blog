    Really love these tips. I know the one thing I use a lot is LiveView. Ever since it came out I've been such an avid fan of the program because it helps you as well as your clients see it in "semi-realtime" rather than email yourself, navigating to photos...etc... It's a beautiful app!

    I know I definitely learned something with #1, there is one setup I fail to do to help make the rest of the process easier. Really good tips!

    Something else that I do is also have some icons nearby for elements that the mockup psd file doesn't necessarily have like Smashing Mag's resources of icons that can be downloaded for products. They definitely help and make a design look great.

    I digress... Great post!!

    interesting article like yours. It is pretty worth enough for me. Personally,
    if all website owners and bloggers made good content as you did, the net will
    be a lot more useful than ever before.

  content: "Great article, Lee. Can you offer a few more details on why it's important
    to set your gridlines to those parameters? If I don't use those settings, is it
    really noticeable in my app design? \r\n\r\nLiveView sounds really neat. But,
    is it available for PC? I didn't see a PC download."

  content: '@Josh: I don''t think the actual figure is that important, as long as
    they are even numbers. If you''re designing for the iPhone retina screen, and
    your graphic happens to lie on an odd pixel then you will experience a slight
    blur when viewed on the iPhone screen so you lose that crisp pixel perfect graphic.
    It''s also nice if they divide equally into 960x640. Doesn''t look like Liveview
    is available for PC I''m afraid.'

    wow thanks a lot lee, i have also read on other articles that it is also ok to start in the iPhone size *even at 72 ppi* as long as I mostly use shape layers and layers style + enabling scale styles so when I upsize its still detailed, however I assume that when I make the design in iphone 3 res my subdivisions for the grid would be 1 right? also about the "gridline every: X pixels" do I have to place 20 or is it just your preference? ^^
    and you I see you have a cool psd grid template can I also get one of those resource? I actually have made an action to prepare an iPhone 3 template with guides but the guides are only for the status bar and title bar.hehe. hope to hear from you

  content: Nice. One thing I would say is that if you're working with Photoshop CS5,
    you might want to take a look at Bjango's Skala family of apps instead of LiveView.
    I've worked with both, and Skala works far better. It'll cost you a few dollars
    but it allows you to work in more accurate real time to multiple devices. Other
    then that, it seems you and me think on exactly the same wavelength when it comes
    to working for iPhone.

<strong>Designing a user interface for iPhone is totally different than designing for the web</strong>. Small screen, fixed width, users are on the move etc.

I've been designing a couple of iPhone apps recently and while doing so came across some useful techniques that I thought I would share for any designers who have still to move from web to iOS design. Good luck designing your mobile apps for iPhone!

<!--more-->

<h4>1. Setup Photoshop</h4>

If you're designing for iPhone 4 you're designing for a high-res retina screen. <strong>2 pixel lines appear as 1 point when they're shown on screen</strong>.

Setup your Photoshop grid so the <strong>minimum grid lines are split in 2 pixels</strong>.

<strong>Photoshop > Preferences > Guides, Grid &amp; Slices</strong>

I set the gridline to every 20 pixels, and subdivisions to every 2 pixels. 

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/grid.png" alt="grid.png" border="0" width="540" height="285" /></div>

Now ensure you have snap setup to <strong>snap to all, ensuring any objects you move will snap to the 2px grid.</strong>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/snap.gif" alt="snap.gif" border="0" width="410" height="187" /></div>

Also ensure your <strong>shapes tool is setup to snap to pixels</strong>. This should keep everything nice and sharp.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/snapshapes.gif" alt="snapshapes.gif" border="0" width="274" height="159" /></div>

<strong>Colours look different on different screens</strong> so you may want to adjust your colour settings also.

There's a good article by bjango on <a href="http://bjango.com/articles/photoshop/">how to setup colour preferences for iPhone in Photoshop</a>.


<h4>2. Have a PSD template</h4>

If you're a web designer you more than likely have a <strong>PSD template for designing a web site</strong> in Photoshop or a <strong>framework for marking it up</strong> in HTML/CSS.

Do the same for designing an iPhone app. Have the <strong>'static' elements in place (e.g. status bar), a grid to work to and typical guide lines</strong> you might want to use (e.g. a guide line for the tab bar).

You may even want to have several elements to hand like buttons, text etc.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/psd.gif" alt="psd.gif" border="0" width="300" height="451" /></div>


<h4>3. Download the iPhone 4 GUI PSD retina display</h4>

<strong>Save yourself some time and effort</strong> by using Teehan+Lax's <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/iphone-4-gui-psd-retina-display/">iPhone 4 GUI PSD retina display elements</a>.

Even if you're designing your own style of buttons, tab bars etc. these will come in very handy.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/gui.jpg" alt="gui.jpg" border="0" width="303" height="221" /></div>


<h4>4. Use Liveview to preview your user interface</h4>

It's <strong>impossible to get a good idea of how an iPhone interface will actually look</strong> on an iPhone when you're <strong>designing on a monitor</strong>.

Thanks to Nicholas Zambetti, there's a free app to help you <a href="http://zambetti.com/projects/liveview/">live preview your UI on iPhone</a>.

<ol>
<li>Window > Arrange > New window for [documentName]</li>
<li>Move the new window to part of the screen you're not using (a separate monitor works best)</li>
<li>Open Liveview and place the 'frame' over that window in Photoshop.</li>
<li>Now open Liveview on your iPhone, connect to your computer, and voila there is your app on your iPhone, giving you a live preview of how it looks.</li>
</ol>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/liveview.gif" alt="liveview.gif" border="0" width="320" height="480" /></div>


<h4>5. Know the Apple iOS Human Interface Guidelines and best practices</h4>

Apple have <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/Introduction/Introduction.html">documentation on designing interfaces for iOS</a> that you <strong>must read if you're designing any iOS app</strong>.

There are a lot of enforced guidelines in here along with best practices for mobile devices.

Examples:
<ul>
<li><strong>44px</strong> is the ideal tappable area on screen</li>
<li>Users expect iPhone apps to launch in <strong>portrait</strong> orientation</li>
<li><strong>Branding</strong> should be <strong>unobtrusive</strong></li>
<li>Each app submission requires <strong>several icon dimensions</strong></li>
<li>Controls should <strong>look tappable</strong> - make use of contours and gradients</li>
<li>Modal windows/tasks interrupt so use sparingly</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Have you any tips for designing iPhone apps?</h4>

I'm sure there are a lot of seasoned designers out there who can share many more tips than me so please leave them in the comments below.

<strong><em>What are your experiences and have you any techniques you'd like to share?</em></strong>
