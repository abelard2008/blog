  content: "Great stuff, Lee.  Which ones do you use most?  I'm familiar with Axure
    RP and recently discovered and was very impressed with App Sketcher (actually
    I reviewed it here: http://bit.ly/m0Gufy ).  Another one worth checking out is
    JustProto, which I found pretty cool as well (and reviewed here: http://bit.ly/llH6S0
    ). Now I'm going to check out the others.  \n\nThere is a big range of pricing
    there too - I have a lot of time for Axure but something like App Sketcher makes
    it seem slightly expensive these days.  Have you done a similar list of wireframing
    tools?  I've always had a bit of a soft-spot for Balsamiq for wireframing duties.
    \ Certainly a better option than Excel or PowerPoint or crazy stuff like that..."

    Hey Lee,

    http://unitid.nl/2011/03/touch-application-prototypes-tap-for-iphone-and-ipad-using-adobe-fireworks/

    is hands down this is the best prototyping solution for iPhone (and soon to be Android) apps out there. It's free, easy to setup on your website and you can cache the app for offline use. It can be a bit of a fudge to get Fireworks to play nice sometimes but if you use that to design anyway you'll be all set.

  content: Great writeup, Lee! For feedback, Axure allows you to generate prototypes
    to a service called AxShare. It integrates comments and restricts access via passwords.
    This is great because the prototype is still interactive. It helps to have a "How
    to use this prototype" page be the first page in the proto, though. That way,
    people know what to look at when they get there & know any "login" information
    that is required to make things go.

  content: "@John: I've been using Axure mostly. I think it has the full package.
    Master templates, extra libraries, interaction with form elements, page/widget
    notes and being able to generate a spec is very useful. But as you say it's pricey,
    I'm still checking out the free trial. Love Balsamiq and Omnigraffle, have used
    both in the past.\r\n\r\n@Iain: Excellent, tried it out there, very cool! \r\n\r\n@Fred:
    That's handy. Comments is the one thing I thought it was missing so good to hear
    that's included with the purchase.\r\n\r\n@Clark: InVision is very cool, have
    checked it out."

    good though for designers, and HotGloo looks cool too, with more functionality...

I've been on the look out for a good prototyping tool. I want to produce <strong>high fidelity prototypes</strong> that <strong>look good</strong>, have some basic <strong>functionality</strong> and can be quickly <strong>iterated</strong> on, but that I don't mind <strong>binning</strong> once I've finished and ready to move on to the real thing. Here are <del>5</del> 7 tools I found and that you can use to produce your prototypes.
<h4>Prototyping</h4>
As designers we put together prototypes as a <strong>proof of concept</strong>. In the short term it enables you to <strong>experience</strong> how a product will <strong>function and look</strong>, and you can start <strong>user testing</strong> early on in the product development process.

In the long run it <strong>saves time and money</strong> as you can <strong>test and fix any problems</strong> before you spend hours of man power developing an end product.

You should prototype any type of product or application including web, desktop and mobile. This is easier said that done of course, and I haven't been great at doing this myself in the past, but it will definitely save you time and money in the long run.
<h4>High fidelity</h4>
I always start designing on paper so what I end up with are <strong>sketches of user flows, sitemaps and wireframes</strong>. These are <strong>low fidelity prototypes</strong>. They're quick, easy to put together but not really something you can have end users test or show to clients.

High fidelity prototypes closely resemble the end goal. You should be able to <strong>interact</strong> with them and other people should be able to <strong>understand them</strong>, but the standard of the code or the pixel perfection aren't an issue.

<h4>You've made your prototype but how do you collect feedback?</h4>
Once you share the prototype with your team or client, <strong>you will want to gather feedback</strong>.

<a href="http://onotate.com/">Onotate</a> is a great tool that enables you to <strong>upload a screenshot</strong> and <strong>add notes</strong> to parts of that screen. Other <strong>team members are able to add their own notes</strong> or comment on your notes.

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.onotate.com"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2470 aligncenter" title="onotate" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/onotate.gif" alt="" width="326" height="186" /></a></div>

Once you've used Onotate to gather your feedback you can head back to your prototyping tool and start the next iteration. This gives you a nice agile design process.

<strong><em>Do you prototype? What tools do you use?</em></strong>
