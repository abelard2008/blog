  content: "Lee, what are you using for usability tests? So far we've used Usaura,
    and we're pretty thrilled with it. For example, check our latest test http://www.usaura.com/test/9bd427797748fe6e1515\r\n\r\n:-)\r\n\r\nAny
    other tools you can recommend?"

    using Axure to put together high fidelity prototypes, user testing in person or
    GoToMeeting for remote tests, and Verify for mass feedback remote style tests.'

  content: "Hi Lee, some great points as usual :)\r\n\r\nI like the way you didn't
    just do one test -- you did a series of tests, and it sounds like you tweaked
    as you went along, rather than going right back to the drawing board each time.\r\n\r\nThis
    is the advice that Steve Krug gives in his book 'Rocket Surgery Made Easy', i.e.
    after each test, focus ruthlessly on the 2 or 3 changes that will make a big difference
    -- and 'do the least you can do' to implement them.\r\n\r\nOften, the goal of
    usability testing is to iterate and tweak than to redesign."

  content: Thanks Lee, good stuff! I was at the Online Marketing Summit in San Diego
    last winter and one of the lead guys from Obama's campaign (former Googler) talked
    about how testing and finding the right submit button text and color made a difference
    measured in millions of dollars.  I usually work with small businesses where a
    lot less money is on the line, but that lesson really stuck with me.

  content: "Lee,\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of content strategy, but I don't agree with
    your claim that this testing necessarily shows that copy and content are more
    important than design. Why wouldn't the fact that design flaws are caught with
    only a couple of participants actually argue that design is MORE important than
    copy?\r\n\r\nI don't want to stir the pot too much, but wanted to help with your
    logic. We also need to get better at knowing when to use each kind of testing
    for content. So much to do!!!"

  content: '@Gabby: You make a good point. It depends what we mean by the word ''design''.
    I mentioned that I think copy and content is more important than <strong>visual</strong>
    design, and by that I mean the time and effort that goes into defining copy and
    content should be higher up the priority list than aesthetics. Once it makes sense
    to users, we can make it look and perform better visually.'

  content: "I completely agree with your main point, Lee.  User testing content and
    copy is very important, and was seldom emphasized in early UX literature.\r\n\r\nI
    disagree that copy and content is more important than visual design.  Studies
    show that users' emotional or visceral response to the visual design is frequently
    as important or more important than their rational, reflective response to the
    content or copy: http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/blink/"

  content: 'I agree Lee, and as a Technical Writer, I love to get involved in this
    stage of the design, even if it''s only looking over someone''s shoulder and making
    suggestions when they get stuck on the wording for a dialog box.  My rule of thumb
    is: less is more. You can always cut the words down further. :)'

  content: Interesting to see the content vs design argument continuing. I'm a content
    producer so you can guess which side of the fence I belong on. Perhaps the biggest
    lesson here is not which is more important in isolation but that they need to
    be developed in tandem.

After user testing a prototype of a new product feature (in this case a setup wizard), it took us <strong>2 or 3 tests</strong> to determine issues like <strong>where a button should be placed</strong>, if it was distinctive enough, if the general layout and structure made sense. 

That was straight forward, however it took at least <strong>another 10-15 tests</strong> to determine the <strong>wording and copy to be used</strong>.

<h4>User testing copy and content</h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/content1.gif" alt="content.gif" border="0" /></div>

Early user testing is an important part of the product design cycle, but it's important <strong>to not just focus on general layout and positioning</strong>, but think about the <strong>copy and content</strong> as well, and not just "figure that out later".

For web applications this includes:

<ul>
<li>Headings</li>
<li>Instructions</li>
<li>Labels</li>
<li>Support text</li>
<li>Inline help</li>
<li>Help articles</li>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Anchor text</li>
<li>Default input values</li>
<li>Loading text</li>
</ul>

<h4>Takeaways from user testing copy and content</h4>

These were the main issues we found with our copy through user testing:

<ol>
<li>The user didn't <strong>understand</strong> it due to the wording or jargon used</li>
<li>The user, in general, <strong>didn't read instructions</strong> on screen and preferred to just click stuff to see what happens</li>
<li>There was <strong>too much to read</strong> so the user didn't bother reading it</li>
<li><strong>Inline help</strong> is useful, particularly for <strong>first time users</strong>, not so much for return/power users</li>
<li>Users <strong>weren't 100% sure what would happen</strong> when clicking certain buttons or links</li>
</ol>

Every couple of tests we would change the copy based on feedback and observations then continue to test. So by the 15th test, there were a lot less issues or questions from the user. That said, there is always room for improvement and we'll continue to test it and gather feedback.

<h4>Copy and content is more important than visual design</h4>

As a designer, what often matters most to you is what the <strong>user's reaction is to the UI design</strong>; the colours, the textures, the use of subtle insets here and there.

Unless you're building a product aimed at designers, <strong>users rarely care about this</strong>. They care about <strong>finding or producing content</strong>, so the copy that helps them accomplish their goal should be <strong>easily and quickly understood</strong>.

Don't leave content or copy until the end. Make sure it gets tested early on along with the rest of your interface so you can iterate and improve it.
