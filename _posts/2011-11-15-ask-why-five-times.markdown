    people push back on this but what a value-add to help them understand something
    new about themselves or their own project."

  content: Just be sure to do it in a way that doesn't make you sound like an annoying
    child. I'd probably feel a bit frustrated if I was on the business end of that
    script above. With that said, the idea behind this is essential. Good designers/developers
    execute their client's instructions, great designers/developers execute their
    client's goals.

  content: I generally agree with this approach and have often used something like
    it with success in our work. Where we have tweaked this is with the use of the
    word "why". In many ways "why" is a confrontational word that may put the person
    being asked on the defensive. In research circles, especially moderating and in-depth
    interviewing, we are trained to not use the word "why." Instead, it is better
    to use more specific and less confrontational questions. For example, instead
    of saying 'why do you need a bigger logo?', you might ask 'what will having a
    bigger logo help you accomplish?' Yes this might sound overly sensitive, but if
    the goal is to get to the root of the issue, you may find this approach eases
    the conversation.

  content: '@Jeff and Nick: Very valid point. The example I used above definitely
    isn''t a word for word script I would follow. "What will having a bigger logo
    help you to accomplish?" reads a lot better, thanks Jeff.'

You may have heard the term "ask why five times", a technique first used by Sakichi Toyoda at Toyota as part of their 'lean manufacturing' process. 

You don't necessarily have to do it five times, the point is to keep asking questions until you get down to the root of the problem, and explore various ways to solve that problem. Don't just accept the first statement or request.

<h4>Clients don't know what they need, that's why they hired you</h4>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/why.gif" alt="why.gif" border="0" width="301" height="171" /></div>

As a web designer, you're a problem solver, and it's good practice to use this technique on your clients.

Here's a basic example:

Client: We need a blog.

Designer: Why do you need a blog?

Client: Because our competitor has a blog.

Designer: Why does your competitor have a blog?

Client: So their users have a place to go to read about company announcements.

Designer: Why do users need a place to read about company announcements?

Client: Every so often they add features, like us, and they use the blog to announce those features. We plan to do the same.

Designer: Why do you need to announce new features?

Client: So users can use the new features.

Designer: Why would users want to use the new features?

Client: They'll enjoy the product more, which should help customer retention.

Designer: Maybe you don't need a blog. A blog will take quite a lot of effort and money to design, develop and maintain. How about in-app notifications for new features, call-outs that highlight new features, a monthly newsletter, using a Twitter account for announcements, or use a tool like <a href="http://intercom.io">Intercom</a>? Or maybe you don't need new features at all, and there's a better way to keep your customers happy?

Client: Never thought of that. Which one can we have up and running by this afternoon?

<h4>Get to the root of the problem</h4>

Constantly asking why can sound annoying, but it should lead to <strong>healthy discussion about how to best solve the underlying issue</strong>. 

In the end the you may come full circle and implement the initial suggestion, but make sure you <strong>understand the root of the problem</strong> and <strong>explore all possible solutions</strong> before time and effort is wasted.
