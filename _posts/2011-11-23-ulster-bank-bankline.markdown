  content: "With Northern Bank personal, you've to enter a Customer ID, a PIN, and
    then look at a credit card sized hash table. They provide the key, you enter the
    corresponding value and you're in - you can see account balances. Everytime you
    want to transfer money, you have to confirm your Customer ID by entering your
    PIN everytime.\r\n\r\nOn their mobile app - you just enter the Customer ID and
    the same PIN and you can see your accounts balances straightaway.\r\n\r\nYou only
    have to use the credit card hash table within the mobile app if you want to transfer
    money - each key value pair can only be used once and then they have to send you
    a new card."

    invited to use it before mentioning it. Another great tool is Mint - only now
    with a Bank of America account am I able to start using it. Very useful so far.'

  content: "Dunno if I've ever said this before Lee but I actually work as part of
    a time that develops, amongst other things, an online banking app. It's actually
    for use by credit unions but it gives them the same level of service as banks
    would have. It allows their members to have full access to balances, statements,
    transactions, they can apply for loans, transfer money to and from their credit
    union accounts, transfer money between balances and accounts, pay bills, etc.
    We're actually the only credit union provider in ROI and the UK that provides
    this service to credit unions. \r\n\r\nWe went through intensive testing with
    a 3rd party to make it as secure as we could before we even thought about releasing
    it to the public. It's a product that I am very proud of but one that is in a
    constant state of evolution as we respond to feedback from our customers.\r\n\r\nTo
    get a statement of recent transactions here's the steps for us:\r\n1. On the credit
    union home page click the link for online banking.\r\n2. This launches the first
    log in screen. Requires username (chosen by user) and PIN (mailed out in post
    upon successful registration).\r\n3. Second security page asks for the user's
    password (created by the user  during registration).\r\n4. The landing page shows
    all account balances and current loans. There is a second tab here that when clicked
    allows the user to view a statement.\r\n5. Select a date range and hit confirm
    to view your statement.\r\n6. No more steps\r\n\r\nI don't think that's too bad.
    I feel we have a reasonably straight forward log in procedure compare to some
    of the websites that you have listed but we still get a barrage of support calls
    with people struggling to use it. I can only imagine how these people would get
    on with a more complex system!"

  content: '@Gareth: Interesting, sounds pretty decent. Was there an Interaction/UX
    Designer involved with the project? I like how it immediately shows your balance.
    One question I have is why not show the latest statement of (x) transactions instead
    of the user having to pick the date range? I haven''t done any user studies on
    the matter, but usually I''ll just want to see a statement of the last 30 days.'

  content: "@Lee: No we don't have a UX Designer here. I am primarily responsible
    for the look and feel of the site as well as front end development. We then have
    a .Net developer that handles the application layer and a database developer that
    handles the calls to Oracle. But we all chip in with our thoughts on whether or
    not we feel something works or not. We also invite feedback from a range of customers
    as well as their own members. \r\n\r\nBelieve me if you could see the differences
    between the new version and the previous version (which I had nothing to do with)
    you'd definitely see an improvement.\r\n\r\nBut like I said it's a constantly
    evolving app so it's always changing based on the above feedback. By default the
    date range selects the most recent transactions but I like your idea of loading
    them straight away. Yeah, I think we'll implement that. What do I owe ya?"

  content: "The Ulster Bank experience as a persona customer isn't quite as bad. Getting
    logged in consists of:\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter personal account number (this can be saved
    to prevent re-entering it each time)\r\nEnter 3 random characters from your PIN
    code and 3 random characters from your web account password\r\nClick past their
    (rather useless and annoying) landing page\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lands you on your account
    overview page, which shows all of my accounts, their current balance, and the
    ability to view a mini-statement for each on the page. You can then click through
    to get more information on each.\r\n\r\nI'm sure it could be better, trying to
    remember <em>which</em> character of my password they're after is frustrating.\r\n\r\nInterestingly
    their mobile banking app is a lot easier to use, once you've set it up. All you
    have to do is enter an app specific PIN code and you're looking at your bank account."

    Hi Lee, The security on AIB banking is Customer Number, then some digits (1st, 3rd, etc) of your pin, last 4 digits of work/home phone. A little over the top, but not too annoying.

    Once logged in, the dashboard is great. You see balances of all accounts and can quickly click on each account to see the last 5 transactions without leaving the dashboard. You can then drill down and get statements etc. You can even do a quick transfer to another/friends account on the dashboard. Very nice experience overall.

    I think AIB have realised that by providing a great online experience, they save the customer a lot of hassle and thus reduce the need for more staff in branches and call centres.

    While I only use AIB, I have heard from friends that BOI is just terrible and feels very  90s.

    Nice, AIB sounds like it has a good dashboard. I checked out some screenshots
    and it looks pretty good"

  content: "Hi Lee! I agree with you. BMO, \"Bee Mo\", used to be Bank of Montreal,
    \"Canada's First Bank\", lets me download two (if I'm lucky) months of account
    history to a spreadsheet. If I'm not, then it's into the branch for awkward-shaped
    mites of paper stapled together. \r\n\r\nA broader comment/question about online
    banking/security. Does Bank of America work as well for you if you're not at your
    \"usual\" IP address? I've had that problem. Also, I dumped my cookies and cache
    to terminate an annoying un-closeable \"customer satisfaction survey\" window.
    Oops. Remembering who I am, internetically, sharpened my wits.  \r\n\r\nHow'd
    I land here? Glad you asked. I Googled \"should i transfer my account to a credit
    union?\" As written, main window, here you are!\r\n\r\nTake care, eh :)"

  content: Just ha d a quick skim over the article and have to chip in and say that
    the Northern Bank iPhone app is excellent. Exactly what I need to transfer money,
    check future debits etc. I bypass the desktop version completely as it's just
    so quick and easy to use the app. The desktop version has serious problems on
    a Mac as it uses Java and as most people will know, Java on the Mac sucks alot
    and eats a lot of resources bringing your computer to a stand still.

Banking websites have to be the worst type of websites out there. <strong>People use them on a daily basis, many times a day, but yet they offer the worst user experiences</strong>. 

I've had bank accounts with <a href="http://www.alliance-leicester.co.uk/home/index.aspx">Alliance and Leicester</a>, <a href="http://ulsterbank.co.uk/ni/personal.ashx">Ulster Bank</a>, <a href="http://www.bankofireland.com/">Bank of Ireland</a> and the online banking experience has never been good. 

However, I just checked out <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a> and compared to the other banks I've tried it's incredible.

<h4>Ulster Bank business banking (Bankline)</h4>

Lets say I want to view a statement of <strong>recent transactions</strong> and see what my overall <strong>bank balance</strong> is. A very common task for online banking.

<h5>Click 1: Go to UlsterBank.co.uk and click business banking</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ub2.jpg" alt="ub2.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="333" /></div>

<h5>Click 2: Click login</h5>
Opens a nice new window.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ub1.jpg" alt="ub1.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="188" /></div>

<h5>Click 3: Enter a customer ID and a user ID and click continue</h5>
Because one ID isn't enough.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ub3.jpg" alt="ub3.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="137" /></div>

<h5>Click 4: Enter requested numbers from your PIN and requested characters from your password and click continue</h5>
There are so many IDs and passwords to remember that you have to write them down somewhere.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ub4.jpg" alt="ub4.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="107" /></div>

<h5>Click 5: Read the welcome message and click confirm</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ub5.jpg" alt="ub5.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="140" /></div>

<h5>Click 6: Click account information</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ub6.jpg" alt="ub6.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="271" /></div>

<h5>Click 7: Click view account balance</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ub7.jpg" alt="ub7.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="307" /></div>

<h5>Click 8: Click on your account ID</h5>
Result number one. After 7 clicks I'm able to see my balance. Now I want to see a breakdown of recent transactions.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ub81.jpg" alt="ub8.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="196" /></div>

<h5>Statement</h5>
After <strong>8 clicks, 2 IDs, 1 PIN and 1 password</strong>, I'm able to see my statement and my balance.


<h4>Bank of America</h4>
I've recently setup a US bank account with Bank of America. Here's the user flow for wanting to view the same thing - my balance and recent statement.

<h5>Click 1: Enter my username and sign in</h5>
It actually remembered my username from last time.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ba1.jpg" alt="ba1.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="251" /></div>

<h5>Click 2: Enter my passcode</h5>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ba2.jpg" alt="ba2.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="470" /></div>

<h5>Statement</h5>
The first screen I see after logging in is 'Account Activity'. Immediately I'm able to see a balance summary and a statement of recent transactions. That's only <strong>2 clicks</strong> and one passcode I had to enter.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ba3.jpg" alt="ba3.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="181" /></div>

Not only do a get a good overview of my bank account straight away, each entry includes detailed information about the transaction, including icons to help me identify what type of transaction it was.

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/ba4.jpg" alt="ba4.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="174" /></div>


<h4>Ulster Bank personal banking (Anytime)</h4>

It took me <strong>4 clicks, 1 customer number, 1 PIN and 1 password</strong> to see a brief statement and <strong>6 clicks</strong> to see a full statement.


<h4>Bank of Ireland</h4>

I once had an account with Bank of Ireland but I left before I could get a chance to test their online banking. 

According to them <strong>their online banking service was not compatible with Apple Mac</strong> at the time (this was about 2 years ago).

<h4>Alliance and Leicester (Santander)</h4>

Alliance and Leicester took <strong>5 clicks, 1 customer ID and 1 PIN</strong> to view an overview and 6 clicks to see a full statement.

<h4>What's your experience like with online banking?</h4>

These are banking sites so obviously <strong>security is very important</strong> but does that mean the <strong>user experience has to be awful</strong>?

Until recently I assumed all online banking was terrible, but I'm very impressed with Bank of America.

<strong><em>Who do you bank with and how is their online banking? Why do banks not put more/any effort into UX?</em></strong>
