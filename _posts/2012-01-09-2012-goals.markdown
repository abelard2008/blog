  content: Just discovered your blog from a search on "2012 UX Goals." Looking forward
    to keeping up with it. As for your goals, I think I'll use some of your 2011 goals
    myself. I hope you accomplish all of your 2012 goals; I just snowboarded for the
    first time this past March and fell in love with it. Best of luck!

    be my alter ego or something, we are working on so many of the same things. Anyways,
    keep at it, and good luck on your goals. \r\n\r\nChris V."

<h4>Goals for 2011</h4>
A look back at the goals I set this time last year.

<strong><del>1. Read more books</del></strong>
Success: I read a good few books.

<strong>2. Talk at more events</strong>
Fail: There were a few Barcamp and Bizcamp opportunities, but I struggled to find the time to commit to any.

<strong>3. Develop an iPhone app</strong>
Fail: Purchased "Beginning iPhone 4 Development" but struggled to get past the first chapter. Started looking at <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/">Appcelorator</a> instead.

<strong>4. More side projects</strong>
Fail: Started off the year well by redesigning a couple of <a href="http://tweetni.com/">older</a> <a href="http://webdesignire.com/">projects</a>, but didn't get around to working on anything new.

<strong><del>5. Blog more</del></strong>
Success: Blogged more this year than I did last year.


<h4>Goals for 2012</h4>
<strong>1. Be more mobile focused</strong>
Kind of broad but comes down to designing/developing for mobile. Whether that's native apps, html5 apps, responsive websites - who knows.

<strong>2. Release an iPhone app</strong>
Related to the first goal, I want the experience of developing an app from scratch, submitting it to the app store and seeing it go live. 

<strong>3. Compete in a triathlon</strong>
I don't own a race bike yet and can't swim very far, but I figure I might have a go at it.

<strong>4. Snowboard</strong>
Just something I've always wanted to try.

<strong>5. Release at least 3 side projects</strong>
There are 46 items on my "Someday" list so at least 3 of them should be achievable.

What do you think, decent list?
