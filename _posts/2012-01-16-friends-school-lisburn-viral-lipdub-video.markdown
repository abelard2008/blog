  content: '@JM: It''s not often you see something produced in NI go viral. I''m not
    in the video/film industry but I would say NI has a disadvantage when it comes
    to video distribution, in that it doesn''t have the resources somewhere like the
    U.S. has for example, which makes something like this more of an achievement in
    my eyes.'

  content: "Lee, I found my way here when I was looking for a link to post this video
    to a friend publicising the Tanglible Ireland event at which I am speaking in
    NYC next week.  Great post - and an additional vehicle for me to share what is
    great about NI.\n\nPlease pass this anecdote on to your cousin about unintended
    consequences. My youngest daughter graduated from Abington Friends School, in
    Pennsylvania. When I arrived in Ireland 4 years ago and suggested the Newry/Dundalk
    region could use a Friends' School, I was met with an automatic \"It would never
    work, they're Protestant Schools\". \n\nNow, when I say it, I am greeted with
    - \"You mean like the one in the Video?\". The idea is no longer dismissed and
    more talk ensues. \n\nMany, many thanks to Matt and all involved."

It was great to see this video from Friends' School Lisburn go viral over the weekend.

In just 3 days it has received over 100,000 views, which is a fantastic accomplishment for any YouTube video, let alone one produced in Northern Ireland.

The video was put together by one of NI's talented young cinematographers <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mattgoood">Matt Good</a> (who incidentally happens to be my cousin). Well done to Matt and all Friends' staff and students involved in the video.

Makes me want to go back to school. Enjoy.
