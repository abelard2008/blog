I started working with Kareo as an Interaction Designer in the summer of 2011. 

As the product's Interaction Designer my role involves researching and understanding Kareo customer and persona needs, wireframing, prototyping, user testing (then iterating), user interface design and front-end markup.

One of the first projects I worked on was <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/kareo-help-center/">redesigning the Help Center</a>.
