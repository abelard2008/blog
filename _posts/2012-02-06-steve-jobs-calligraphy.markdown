I'm currently listening to Steve Jobs biography, which I highly recommend (even if you're not an Apple fanboy).

<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1408703742/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=leemunroe-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1408703742"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/steve.jpg" alt="Steve" border="0" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Edit: Steve talks about once taking a calligraphy class, which he also talked about in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">Stanford Commencement Address</a>:

<blockquote>&ldquo;I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to [learn calligraphy]. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful. Historical. Artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture. And I found it fascinating. 

None of this had any hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. 

If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would never have multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.&rdquo;</blockquote>


Keep learning and experiencing new things. You never know how or when it may make an impact in the future.
