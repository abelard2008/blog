Twit Amore was a small side project for Valentine's Day 2012. It is a light humoured web app that calculates who you love on Twitter.

Using the Twitter API, it looks up who you follow, your timeline and your favourite tweets. Based on this it determines who you "love".

Several tools were used for this project.
<ul>
	<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
	<li>Twitter API</li>
	<li>Twitter Gem</li>
	<li>Tweetimag.es</li>
	<li>Heroku</li>
	<li>Typekit</li>
</ul>
The website was a hit and spread virally through social media sites, including a feature on <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/02/14/twit-amore/">Mashable</a>.

During Valentine's week the site received <strong>1 million pageviewsÂ </strong>and over <strong>50,000 tweets</strong> mentioning <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23twitamore">#twitamore</a>.
