  content: "Interesting read as always Lee. I agree unequivocally about talking to
    users about enhancing and developing apps. I'd like to say that we reach out and
    talk to our customers but usually they're on the phone to us suggesting all sorts
    of wonderful ways in which our apps can be improved, about how said improvement
    would give us a competitive edge (even though none of our competitors offer what
    we do in relation to our apps), take claim for the app as being theirs and then
    don't understand why they should pay for us to integrate a feature that involves
    access to an API costing Â£25,000 per year...\r\n\r\n...feck sake!\r\n\r\nBut yeah,
    in general feedback from people actually using the app if possible is invaluable."

  content: '@Gareth: Ha, yeah it can be awkward dealing with feature request after
    feature request. Talking one on one with a customer may highlight edge case scenarios.
    Something like UserVoice is a good way of aggregating and helping to put them
    in some sort of order.'

  content: Great article!  Getting feedback takes out the guessing and split testing.  It
    is direct and allows for improvement.  Thanks for the great resources and ideas
    on the different ways to garner comments and feedback.

    program.

When you design a product or app and put it out there for the world to see, there's a pretty good chance it isn't perfect. There are always going to be bugs, usability issues and room for improvement.

How do you track and find out what issues users are having?

Here are some of the methods I've use to get user feedback.





<h4>1. Talk to customers</h4>

Should be obvious but amazing how many companies fail to <a href="http://thestartupdaily.com/2011/12/get-out-of-the-building/">get out of the building</a> and go visit customers. They'll tell you things you never thought of and just watching them use your product will give you valuable insights into what's important and what needs improved.

Run user tests and have them complete certain tasks. Offer gift vouchers in return for their time. If you can't get to them, use <a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a> or <a href="http://gotomeeting.com">GotoMeeting</a> to chat remotely.

Steve Krug's book "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321657292/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=leemunroe-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0321657292">Rocket Surgery Made Easy</a>" is a great reference book for running your own user tests.

<a href="http://silverbackapp.com/">Silverback</a> is a very good app for conducting user tests. It records the screen, audio and clicks so you can watch back the test or share it with your team.

<a href="http://silverbackapp.com/"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/silverback.jpg" alt="Silverback" border="0" width="441" height="286" /></a>





<h4>2. Talk to customer support</h4>

If your product or company has customer support, which may be a team or even one person, this is a great source of feedback on what issues users are having.

<a href="http://www.desk.com/"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/desk.jpg" alt="Desk" border="0" width="500" height="271" /></a>

Use tools like <a href="http://www.desk.com/">Desk</a>, <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a> or <a href="http://www.olark.com/">Olark</a> to help gather and manage support contacts.





<h4>3. Send out surveys</h4>

If you have a database of user email addresses, either from a newsletter sign up or from users signing up to use your application, leverage this to send out a survey asking for their feedback.

Make sure it's short enough that users will actually take the time to complete it. The shorter it is the more likely the completion rate. And offer and incentive like a prize for one lucky winner, or even a limited time free upgrade in return for their time.

<a href="http://wufoo.com"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/wufoo1.jpg" alt="Wufoo" border="0" width="500" height="221" /></a>

Use a tool like <a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> to put together surveys and generate reports.




<h4>4. In-page feedback</h4>

There are a handful of tools that enable you to drop a bit of javascript on a page and ask for feedback. You can ask questions like "Was his helpful?" or "How can we make this better?".

<a href="http://www.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a> lets users submit feedback and vote on other feedback items. This helps you place importance on the feedback items based on the amount of votes they have.

<a href="http://www.uservoice.com/"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/uservoice.jpg" alt="Uservoice" border="0" width="500" height="288" /></a>

<a href="http://www.kissinsights.com/">KISSinsights</a> lets you place a micro survey on any URL so you can get specific feedback about the page the user is on.

<a href="http://www.kissinsights.com/"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/kissinsights.jpg" alt="Kissinsights" border="0" width="500" height="98" /></a>

<a href="https://www.intercom.io/">Intercom</a> is a light weight CRM tool that helps you build relationships with your users. You can broadcast messages to all your users, groups of users or direct messages to individual users.

<a href="https://www.intercom.io/"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/intercom.jpg" alt="Intercom" border="0" width="500" height="355" /></a>




<h4>5. Unobtrusive feedback with tracking scripts</h5>

All the techniques above involve additional interaction from the user, but of course you can learn a lot simply by observing how users naturally use your application.

<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is the obvious tool. Not only does it tell you what pages are most popular but it will give you an idea of user flow and what pages the user clicks through to next.

<a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/">Crazy Egg</a> is a heatmap tool that shows you what areas of the screen your users are clicking or looking at.

<a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/heatmap.jpg" alt="Heatmap" border="0" width="500" height="370" /></a>

<a href="http://userfly.com/">Userfly</a> will record a user session so you can playback a video of it later and watch how the user navigates your application, what they click on and what they enter into input fields.

<a href="https://mixpanel.com/">MixPanel</a> records actions and page views, allowing for a deeper analysis of what users are clicking and funnel analysis.

<a href="https://mixpanel.com/"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/mixpanel.jpg" alt="Mixpanel" border="0" width="500" height="188" /></a>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>

If you're not constantly getting user feedback you're doing it wrong. There is always room for improvement so figure out which method of getting feedback works best for you. Ideally it's a combination of all the above.
