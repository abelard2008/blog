<h4>Goals for 2012</h4>

A look back at the goals I set this time last year.

<strong><del>1. Be more mobile focused</del></strong> Success. Designing responsive websites and with mobile in mind is now a baked in standard and I managed to ship a couple of mobile apps.

<strong><del>2. Release an iPhone app</del></strong> Success. All be it a basic app, I built <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/marty-cagan-iphone-app/">What Would Marty Do?</a> iPhone app.

<strong>3. Compete in a triathlon</strong> Fail. Didn't even get around to buying a road bike.

<strong><del>4. Snowboard</del></strong> Success. This was a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/G4iId_B_kM/">lot of fun</a> and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/idealform">Kris Davis</a> for teaching me.

<strong>5. Release at least 3 side projects</strong> Fail. 2/3 isn't bad but there are 4 projects that I started in 2012 and failed to ship.

<h4>Areas of focus for 2013</h4>

After reading <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2012/12/consider-not-setting-goals-in.html">Peter Bregman's article</a>, I decided that it might be better to have areas of focus as opposed to setting goals I can't keep.

<strong>1. Shipping</strong>
I love shipping products and getting stuff out there for the world to see. You learn so much through the build, measure, learn process. Hopefully some of those projects I started last year will come to fruition.

<strong>2. Contribute more to open source</strong>
Last year I started sharing stuff on Github. I plan to do more of that this year, whether it be on Github, my blog, Codepen or elsewhere.

<strong>3. Write less</strong>
Usually every January I tell myself I'm going to write more, which tends to lend to me not writing at all. Hopefully if I focus on writing less and shortening my posts I'll be able to publish more often.

<strong>4. Read less</strong>
Same goes for reading. Between books, Twitter, RSS feeds, email, Instapaper there is too much to consume and keep track of. Plus most of it is useless or repetitive. Debating whether to give up on the RSS feeds and stick to Twitter or a tool like <a href="http://sidebar.io/">Sidebar</a> to help focus on the newsworthy articles.

That's it. Exciting year ahead.
