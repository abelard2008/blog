  content: "Hi Lee,\r\n\r\nLove it! Exactly what I was looking for. \r\n\r\nI'm a
    todo list app junkie, however my wife is not. We're heading out on holiday to
    Cuba so I used Flask to setup a todo list that we can share easily. No sign up
    is great as that would have been the barrier to stop my wife using it.\r\n\r\nWe
    have different phone iOS too so we can share across. \r\n\r\nFeature request!:\r\nSimple
    grouping mechanism like in Asana where you put a : and it creates a sub heading
    for tasks.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work, and thanks for doing this I plan to use
    for both personal and professional projects going forward!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nChris"

This past week I shipped <a href="http://flask.io/">Flask</a>, a website for creating quick simple sharable to do lists.

<h4>Why make (another) task management application?</h4>

I was watching <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/147-sortable-lists-revised">Ryan Bates' screencast</a> to learn <strong>CoffeeScript</strong> and he uses a sortable list as an example project.

After following his screencast, I already had a basic to do application started.

Around the same time I had a need to create and <strong>share a list with a friend</strong> for a project we were working on. I knew of lots of task management apps, but <strong>they all required sign up</strong>, download or payment. 

I just wanted to <strong>quickly create and share a list</strong>, with <strong>no barriers to entry</strong>. So I built Flask.

<ul>
<li>Create to do lists</li>
<li>Add as many tasks as you want</li>
<li>Re-order, edit and delete tasks</li>
<li>Share your lists for others to access</li>
<li>Access from anywhere</li>
<li>Use any device</li>
<li>No sign up required</li>
<li>Nothing to download</li>
<li>It's free</li>
</ul>

<h4>No sign up required</h4>

<a href="https://www.wunderlist.com">There</a> <a href="https://do.com/">are</a> <a href="http://asana.com/">tons</a> of <a href="http://www.producteev.com/">to do</a> <a href="http://hitask.com/">list</a> and <a href="http://www.getflow.com/">task</a> <a href="http://todoist.com/">management</a> <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">applications</a> <a href="http://organi.sr/">out</a> <a href="http://teuxdeux.com/">there</a> but they all have one thing in common; <strong>you're required to sign up to use them</strong>.

<strong>Sign up sucks,</strong> and typically straight after signing up your inbox gets spammed</strong> with "Welcome to…", "We just released…" and "It's been a week…" emails.

<strong><a href="http://flask.io/">Flask</a> doesn't require sign up</strong> so don't worry about spam or emails you have no need for.

If you want to collaborate with a friend, <strong>just share the URL</strong>. No formal invitations or requiring them to sign up.

Flask works on desktop and mobile devices. <strong>No special native downloads</strong> required to make it work and you can access lists from anywhere.

And it's free, just <a href="http://flask.io/">give it a whirl</a>.

<h4>What features is it missing?</h4>

If you find it useful I'll definitely add more features. Feel free to request features and <a href="https://flask.uservoice.com">give me feedback here</a>.
