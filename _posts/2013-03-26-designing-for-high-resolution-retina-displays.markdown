  content: It's a common sense tip but one I've found handy. Retina assets, sprites,
    font sizes etc should be even numbers, i.e. divisible by two. Makes the scaling
    down a lot easier.

  content: "Didn't you try the WP Retina 2x plugin for WordPress? Not only it uses
    retina.js, but also uses two other methods (a server handler, and a server-side
    rewriter). It also creates automatically all the @2x images for you, so you don't
    have to think about anything at all. Retina.js is the slowest method.\r\n\r\nAlways
    inserting the @2x images could be an \"okay\" solution, unfortunately WordPress
    by default will use those images original sizes and will not re-size down.\r\n\r\nI
    strongly agree with you on this: \"More detail doesn't necessarily mean more data\".
    I noticed that on a normal screen you can use JPG quality = 80-85%, but on a Retina
    you can use a much lower quality (65%-75%) for the same kind of results (relatively
    speaking).\r\n\r\nThanks for your article ^^"

    resolution (2560 x 1600) at 100% zoom. But if I'm on a standard display I'll have
    that zoomed to 200%. Actually hopping back and forth between Retina and non-Retina
    (e.g. Thunderbolt display) gets quite confusing.\r\n\r\n@Jordy: Great advice,
    will check it out. Didn't know there was a server-side Wordpress solution."

  content: "Have to agree with Simon.\r\n\r\nThis sort of duplication is short-termist
    and will lead to sites that need more \"hacks\" and fixes as time goes by.\r\n\r\nAs
    a lot of \"design types\" use Apple products they fall into the trap of accommodating
    them and become miopic towards the other myriad devices and platforms that the
    vast majority use.\r\n\r\nIn reality sites, and designers, need to rapidly simplify
    their approach to web design and development. It might sound a bit luddite but
    that's just the fact of the matter these days. Making it look good isn't the goal
    now - making it work seamlessly and simply is."

  content: "For about the past year, I've been using Adaptive Images to serve resolution-appropriate
    assets from the server. Scott Jehl's Picturefill is a great client-side solution
    for serving retina assets. I agree with Simon that things are only going to escalate,
    but I disagree that this is a bad thing.\r\n\r\nCall me a masochist, but I'm rather
    excited that the device landscape is forcing us to challenge our methods. Performance
    is high priority, but we can and should allow a few trade-offs for an effective
    design. It's up to us to decide just how far to go with it. \r\n\r\nThe thing
    about Retina displays: they're not going away. We see this with every new technology:
    only a handful have it now, but eventually it's going to become more affordable
    and we'll see it explode. It happened when LCD monitors released years ago, it
    was prohibitive in cost then, but now it would be odd to see a CRT monitor on
    a desk.\r\n\r\nWe can't think of this in terms of Apple products, because this
    kind of technology isn't Apple-exclusive. In my opinion, it would be more annoying
    to retroactively design for retina/HD displays when they become common than to
    invest a little more time considering them now. Honestly, I'd say ignoring them
    is the short-term solution."

    might be a bit of extra work. Depends on the size of your project, type of project,
    your target user, budget etc. on whether or not you want to support it right now.
    \r\n\r\n@Guillaume: Yes that's how I use it. I hook it up to a Thunderbolt now

    the 13\" is perfect though. Keeps you focused.\r\n\r\n@Tareq: Yes, right now I'm
    designing @2x in Photoshop. Then if I need to I'll scale it down."

I was lucky enough to receive a 13" MacBook Pro with Retina display for work a few months back.

It's a beautiful device. At first I didn't think it would make a big difference but after using for a day it's hard to go back to other displays. It's like the transition from VHS to DVD or SD to HD.

The first website I designed while having the Retina display was <a href="http://runnable.com">Runnable.com</a> and of course I was <strong>now more inclined  to design for high-resolution screens</strong> as I notice the results on a daily basis.

Below are just a few techniques I learned while designing for high-res devices.

<h4>1. Use media queries for high-res CSS styles</h4>

Using CSS media queries you can <strong>target any device with a high-resolution screen</strong> and provide it with <strong>alternate styles</strong>.

It's very straight forward, and some what similar to providing responsive or alternate mobile styles.

<pre><code>
@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(min-resolution: 192dpi) {
  /* High-res styles go here */
}
</code></pre>

This should be enough, but if you want to target other highish-res screens, you can read up on Chris Coyier's <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/retina-display-media-query/">Retina Display Media Query post here</a>.



<h4>2. Have two versions of your CSS sprites: standard dimensions and @2x</h4>

Maykel Loomans wrote a very useful post last year on using CSS Sprites to <a href="http://miekd.com/articles/using-css-sprites-to-optimize-your-website-for-retina-displays/">optimize your website for Retina displays</a>.

Loomans recommends having <strong>two sprite files, one for standard and one for high-res</strong>.

<img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/sprites.jpg" alt="Sprites" border="0" />

Using the <strong>media query I shared above</strong>, simply change the background image reference and then resize the background image.

<pre><code>
@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(min-resolution: 192dpi) {
  .logo{
    background-image:url(assets/sprite@2x.png);
    background-size:500px 500px; /* This replicates the original standard sprite dimensions, and assumes the actual dimensions of sprite@2x.png are 1000x1000px */
  }
}
</code></pre>



<h4>3. Serve up larger html embedded images with Javascript</h4>

The sprite solution above is only good for assets referenced in your CSS. But what about images on your page?

<a href="http://imulus.com/">Imulus</a> developed a useful plugin <a href="http://retinajs.com/">Retina.js</a> that solves this for you.

The script will check your server to see if you have any image source with @2x at the end.

For example:

<pre><code><img src="/images/my_image.png" /></code></pre>

Retina.js will look for:

<pre><code>"/images/my_image@2x.png"</code></pre>

See their <a href="http://retinajs.com/">documentation</a> on how to implement.



<h4>4. More detail doesn't necessarily mean more data</h4>

Daan Jobsis conducted a very interesting experiment last year looking at <a href="http://blog.netvlies.nl/design-interactie/retina-revolution/">pixel quality, image dimensions and compression</a>.

<strong>More pixels = better display. But, more pixels doesn't necessarily have to mean 4 or 5 times more data. More detail can be accomplished with less kilobytes.</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>The bottomline is that heavy compression doesn’t affect the final image as much as you would expect. This is because of the greater amount of pixels in the Retina image, compression artefacts are scaled down and therefore almost unnoticeable.</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/clouds.jpg" alt="Clouds" border="0" />

Basically an image can have larger dimensions, but can also be compressed more and you still get great results on a high-res screen.

You can see <a href="http://blog.netvlies.nl/design-interactie/retina-revolutie-follow-up/">various image dimensions, file size and quality comparisons in Daan's follow up post here</a>.


<h4>5. You can just use the same image assets for both standard and high-res screens</h4>

I've talked above about how to serve up alternate assets for high-res screens. <strong>The downside of this is having to maintain two versions of graphical assets and images.</strong>

Turns out you can use the same assets.

For example, with <strong>CSS sprites you can use the @2x version for all users</strong>, and let your CSS do the resizing for all users. Or every embedded image can have <strong>larger dimensions</strong> than needed, and then you <strong>explicitly set the width</strong> of that image.

The pros of this are that you <strong>maintain one version</strong>.

The cons, depending on how you compress the assets, <strong>your users may have to download larger files than they actually need</strong>.

<h4>Bonus: Don't forget your Retina-ready favicon</h4>

Nothing is more telling <strong>whether a website has invested in support for high-res screens than your favicon</strong>. And it's a very simple fix.

Ensure your favicon is <strong>32x32px</strong> and you're golden.

Use <a href="http://iconverticons.com/online/">iConvert</a> to convert a PNG to ICO.


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

High-res screens, in particular the MacBook Pro with Retina display, are fantastic and I highly recommend Designers invest in them.

More and more devices have high-res and if you want your product or website to look professional to users of these devices, you should put some thought into how they look.

<strong>My preference is to only maintain one version of each graphical asset</strong> instead of two (I'm lazy), so I'll typically have an @2x sprite that I resize for all users.  I'll also try to save highly compressed images in large dimensions for web so they look good when resized in the browser.

Some other, more obvious, techniques that I haven't mentioned above are making good use of CSS, @font-face, <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/icon-fonts/">icon fonts</a> and SVG, instead of relying on bitmap images.

<strong><em>Have you any other advice designing for high-resolution?</em></strong>
