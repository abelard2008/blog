A quick blog post about things learned and accomplished in 2013 and areas of focus for 2014.

By writing them down I hope thereâ€™s more chance of me actually following through.

<h4>New software/apps/tools for 2013</h4>
Some of these apps I had used before, but in 2013 I found myself becoming more reliant on them and working them into my daily routine.

<h4>Goals for 2013</h4>
A look back at some areas of focus I set myself <a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/2013-goals/">this time last year</a>.

<strong><del>1. Shipping</del></strong>. Success. Shipped several projects at work and outside of work. It feels good to get stuff out there.

<strong><del>2. Contribute more to open source</del></strong>. Success. Open sourced my boilerplate (<a href="https://github.com/leemunroe/motherplate ">Motherplate</a>), a <a href="https://github.com/leemunroe/html-email-template">simple html email template</a>, and shared some snippets on <a href="http://codepen.io/leemunroe">CodePen</a>.

<strong><del>3. Write less</del></strong>. Success. I tried to write shorter posts and only blog once a month. This included a couple of posts on <a href="https://medium.com/@leemunroe">Medium</a>.

<strong><del>4. Read less</del></strong>. Success. I ditched my RSS reader and instead this is how I now catch up on news: <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories">Designer News</a>, <a href="http://sidebar.io/">Sidebar</a>, Twitter. That's it.

Bonus: <strong><del>Compete in a triathlon</del></strong>. Success. This was a 2012 goal that I failed but accomplished on 2013. 0.5 mile swim, 19 mile cycle, 4 mile run, 1hr 45min.


<h4>Areas of focus for 2014</h4>

<strong>1. Projects with (sustainable) business models</strong>
I tend to launch side projects that don't make money, or very little. This is mostly fine, as they're usually for learning purposes, but it's about time I started focusing more on monetization strategies, business models and customers.

<strong>2. Hardware</strong>
Mobile devices. Wearable tech. Servers. <a href="http://www.brewbot.io/">Brewbots.</a> I want to know more about how these things work. I bought myself a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alexklein/kano-a-computer-anyone-can-make">Kano</a> to start experimenting with Pi. Will see where this leads.

<strong>3. Educating others</strong>
More how-to tutorials, a more focused blog, talking at events, hosting work shops, writing a book, teaching in schools. Something along those lines.

<strong>4. Educating myself</strong> 
There are a tone of great online courses available now, and in person workshops, lots of which have been on my to-do list for too long. Time to set aside some time to do them. 

Have a good 2014.
