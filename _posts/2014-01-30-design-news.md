title: How I keep up with design and development news
---
There is way too much news to keep up with. 

Over a year ago I ditched RSS; Techcrunch, Mashable, Smashing Mag, PSD tutorial sites, designer blogs, developer blogsâ€¦ it was too much to keep up with on a daily basis, which ended up in 1,000s of unread articles.

Now there are a handful of websites I check every other day. It's much easier to keep on top of and I don't feel like I've missed out on much.

#### 1. [Sidebar](http://sidebar.io)
Created by Sacha Greif, contributed to by various quality designers, it showcases just a few good design links on a daily basis.

#### 2. [Designer News](http://news.layervault.com)
Like Hacker News but for designers. Users submit, vote and comment on daily design news.

#### 3. [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com)
If you work in tech HN is the source of all news worth reading.

#### 4. [Twitter](http://twitter.com)
Follow a bunch of designers and people you respect and admire, who share good links. I favorite any links that look useful and go through them later.

#### 5. Products/Dev Tools
Also keep an eye on [Leanstack](http://leanstack.io), [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.co) and [Beta List](http://betali.st/) from time to time for new products and developer tools.

<p class="aligncenter"><a href="http://www.producthunt.co"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/ph.jpg" alt="Product Hunt" width="600"></a></p>

That's it. Life is much less stressful without an RSS Reader.
