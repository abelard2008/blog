title: 'Our Process For Conducting Regular Usability Tests'
---

In October I joined [Mesosphere](https://mesosphere.com/), a startup that provides a Data Center Operating System (DC/OS) for managing your infrastructure, distributed systems and containers.

At Mesosphere we've set up a process that enables us to run usability tests every 2 weeks with Software Engineers and Data Center Operators.

* We use Intercom, Pardot and PowWow to help us recruit users
* We offer gift card incentives
* We conduct the tests on-site or remotely via Hangouts
* We dedicate 1 day every 2 weeks and run 5 tests
* We test features that are built, design prototypes, and value hypothesis
