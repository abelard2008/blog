title: 'How Our Design Team Keeps Learning'
---

Ongoing education and learning is very important. While we have our day-to-day jobs—where most of the time we’re likely doing things we’re already good at or are very familiar with—we want to keep developing our personal careers and skill sets.

As an industry, we want our design teams to keep developing their careers and skill sets. The web and design practices and tooling are constantly evolving. There is a lot to learn and we want to promote a culture of learning. 

At Mesosphere we recognize this, and we have a few different ways we try to keep educating our design team and learning from each other.

* Bi-weekly lunch and learns
* Guest speakers
* Weekly design inspiration
* Code school
