<section class="section">
	<h3>Mailgun by Rackspace</h3>
	<p><a href="http://mailgun.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mailgun.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
	<div class="group">
	<div class="span6">
		<p>I joined Mailgun in 2013 to lead UX. I was their first full time design hire and I joined their small team of talented back-end engineers. Mailgun is an email API service for developers. After having gone through Y-Combinator the product was successfully acquired by Rackspace in 2012.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span6 last">
		<p>As a Product Designer my role involves looking after the full user experience, interface and front-end development, working closely with our team of engineers, operations and marketing. The bulk of the stack that I work with includes Python, Flask and SASS.</p>

	<div class="group">
	<div class="span6">
		<p>Create really simple and sharable to do lists with Flask. No sign up. Nothing to download. Just add tasks. A simple productivity tool for getting things done and sharing lists with friends. Featured in <a href="http://lifehacker.com/flask-creates-shareable-to-do-lists-on-the-fly-no-acco-510290685">LifeHacker here</a>.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span6 last">
		<p>Flask is a side project that I designed and developed myself using Ruby on Rails. It started off as a weekend experiment to learn CoffeeScript. I now use it as a playground to experiment with new ideas, tools and keep my development skills up to date. It has 1,000 active monthly users.</p>

	<div class="group">
	<div class="span6">
		<p>Share code real time with other developers. In 2013 I hacked together this free code sharing tool with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>, using Node.js and Express. The purpose of this project was to learn Node.js, which we were using at the time for Runnable, and experiment with the Firebase API.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span6 last">
		<p>Copy/paste and share real-time code snippets with others. If you share the url with a friend they will see your code as you type it. CodeShare has 3,000 active monthly users.</p>

	<div class="span6 last">
		<p>Daily activities involved product discovery, prototyping, user studies, interface design, HTML/CSS markup, integration with Node.js and Javascript and working closely with the engineers and founder.</p>
		<p>As an early stage lean startup, I spent a lot of time running experiments, talking to users and using tools like Mixpanel, Optimizely and Qualaroo to help validate assumptions and determine the product development roadmap, while tackling any design related tasks that needed done, e.g. <a href="http://checkthis.com/logodesign">designing our logo</a>.</p>

	<h3>The Big Word Project</h3>
	<div class="span4">
		<p>Back in University I teamed up with classmate <a href="https://twitter.com/paddydonnelly">Paddy Donnelly</a> and created a website that let people buy words of the dictionary, priced at $1 per letter, and link them to their website.</p>
		<p>It was a viral success. We managed to sell over 7,500 words and it led to a feature article in <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-05/st_alpha">Wired magazine</a>.</p>
