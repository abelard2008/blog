<h1>Product design portfolio</h1>

<p>I've had the pleasure of leading design teams and working with startups and companies around the world. Here are just a few.</p>

<section class="section">
	<h2>Mailgun by Rackspace</h2>
	<p><a href="http://mailgun.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mailgun_home.jpg" alt="Mailgun" class="portfolio-screenshot"></a></p>

		<p>I joined Mailgun in 2013 as Lead UX Designer. As their first full time design hire and I joined their small team of talented back-end engineers. Mailgun is an email service for developers. After having gone through Y-Combinator the company was successfully acquired by Rackspace.</p>

		<p>As designer my role involves looking after the full user experience (website, control panel, blog, docs), user interface and front-end development, working closely with the team of engineers. The bulk of the stack that I work with includes Python, Flask and SASS.</p>

	<h2>Flask</h2>
	<p><a href="http://flask.io"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/flask_home.jpg" alt="Flask"></a></p>

		<p>Create really simple and sharable to do lists with Flask. No sign up. Nothing to download. Just add tasks. A simple productivity tool for getting things done and sharing lists with friends. Featured in <a href="http://lifehacker.com/flask-creates-shareable-to-do-lists-on-the-fly-no-acco-510290685">LifeHacker here</a>.</p>

		<p>Flask is a side project that I designed and developed with Ruby on Rails. It started off as a weekend experiment to learn CoffeeScript. I now use it as a playground to experiment with new ideas, tools and keep my development skills up to scratch.</p>

	<h2>CodeShare</h2>
	<p><a href="http://codeshare.io"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/code.jpg" alt="CodeShare.io"></a></p>

		<p>Share code real time with other developers. In 2013 I hacked together this code sharing tool using <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>, Node.js and Express. The purpose of this project was to learn Node.js, which I was using at the time for Runnable, and it gave me a chance to experiment with the Firebase API.</p>

		<p>Copy/paste and share real-time code snippets with others. If you share the url with a friend they will see your code as you type it. CodeShare has 10,000 active monthly users.</p>

	<h2>Runnable</h2>
	<p><a href="http://runnable.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/runnable.jpg" alt="Runnable"></a></p>

		<p>In 2012 I joined Runnable, based in Palo Alto, becoming a member of the founding 5-man team and sole designer. Runnable enables developers to run server-side code in the browser. No downloading, nothing to install, no registration, just run code.</p>

		<p>My daily activities included product discovery, prototyping, user research, interface design, front-end development, integration with Node.js and Javascript and working closely with the engineers and founder.</p>
		<p>As an early stage lean startup, I spent a lot of time running experiments, talking to users and making good use of tools like Mixpanel, Optimizely and Qualaroo to help validate assumptions and determine the product development roadmap, while tackling any design related tasks that needed done.</p>

	<h2>Kareo</h2>
	<p><a href="http://kareo.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/kareo.jpg" alt="Kareo Homepage"></a></p>

		<p>Based in Irvine, Orange County CA, Kareo develop EHR and Practice Management software. I joined as their first design hire, then led the UX Team from 2011-2012 helping them transition from a desktop to web application, and introducing their first iOS app. The company grew from 40 to 200 people during that time.</p>

		<p>Daily activities included product discovery, customer research, prototyping, conducting usability tests, designing and marking up the UI, working closely with developers and product managers and managing the UX team.</p>

		<p class="clear">Twit Amore was a project of mine that went live on Valentine's Day 2012. It's a quirky website that tells you who you love on Twitter. I used it as an experiment to learn some Ruby on Rails, along with Haml, Sass, Twitter API and was my first project using Heroku.</p>

		<p>Due to the tie in with Valentine's Day the site went viral and managed to get on the front page of <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/02/14/twit-amore/">Mashable</a>, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2013/02/14/having-a-bad-valentines-day-forget-that-and-ask-twitamore-who-you-love-most-on-twitter/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+TheNextWeb+(The+Next+Web+All+Stories)">The Next Web</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/twitamore_n_2689812.html">Huffington Post</a> among others.

	<h2>The Big Word Project</h2>

		<p>Back in University I teamed up with classmate <a href="https://twitter.com/paddydonnelly">Paddy Donnelly</a> and created a website that let people buy words of the dictionary, priced at $1 per letter, and link them to their website.</p>
		<p>It was a viral success. We managed to sell over 7,500 words and it led to a feature article in <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-05/st_alpha">Wired magazine</a>.</p>
