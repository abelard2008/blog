<h1>Product design portfolio</h1>

<p>I've had the pleasure of leading design teams and working with startups and companies around the world. Here are just a few.</p>

<section class="section">
	<h2>Mailgun by Rackspace</h2>
	<p class="media"><a href="http://mailgun.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mailgun-screenshots.jpg" alt="Mailgun"></a></p>

		<p>I joined Mailgun in 2013 as their Lead Product Designer. As their first design hire I joined the small team of engineers. Mailgun is an email service for developers, an API for sending and receiving email, with customers like GitHub, Stripe and Slack. After having gone through Y-Combinator the company was acquired by Rackspace.</p>

		<p>As designer my role involves looking after the UX of all Mailgun properties, including but not limited to the <a href="http://www.mailgun.com">website</a>, <a href="https://mailgun.com/cp">control panel</a>, <a href="http://blog.mailgun.com">blog</a>, <a href="http://documentation.mailgun.com">developer documentation</a>, <a href="http://help.mailgun.com">help center</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mailgun/transactional-email-templates">transactional emails</a>. On a day to day basis this involves user research, prototyping, user interface design and front-end development, working closely with our engineers to integrate the solutions and ship to production.</p>

		<p>Being part of a small team also enables me to be closely involved with marketing and support, while taking on product management roles for the projects I'm part of. The bulk of the dev stack that I work with at Mailgun includes Python, Flask and Sass.</p>

		<p>For Mailgun I'm a one-person UX team, but I also work closely with the Rackspace Experience Design Team, made up of user researchers, interaction and visual designers.</p>

	<h2>Open-source and GitHub</h2>
	<p>Ever since I started blogging I've been sharing tips and techniques on web design and development. In recent years I've taken to GitHub to share full projects and resources that I think other designers and developers will find useful. Working on developer tools like Runnable and Mailgun I've been inspired to open-source a lot of the stuff I work on, enabling others to make use of them but also contribute back or discuss implementation and best practices.</p>
	<p class="media"><a href="http://github.com/leemunroe"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/github.jpg" alt="GitHub"></a></p>
	<p>You can find a bunch of my projects on <a href="http://github.com/leemunroe">GitHub</a>.</p>

<section class="section">
	<h2>Flask</h2>
	<p><a href="http://flask.io"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/flask_home.jpg" alt="Flask"></a></p>

		<p>Create really simple and sharable to do lists with Flask. No sign up. Nothing to download. Just add tasks. A simple productivity tool for getting things done and sharing lists with friends. Featured in <a href="http://lifehacker.com/flask-creates-shareable-to-do-lists-on-the-fly-no-acco-510290685">LifeHacker here</a>.</p>

		<p>Flask is a side project that I designed and developed with Ruby on Rails. It started off as a weekend experiment to learn CoffeeScript. I now use it as a playground to experiment with new ideas, tools and keep my development skills up to scratch.</p>

	<h2>CodeShare</h2>
	<p><a href="http://codeshare.io"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/code.jpg" alt="CodeShare.io"></a></p>

		<p>Share code real time with other developers. In 2013 I hacked together this code sharing tool using Firebase, Node.js and Express. The purpose of this project was to learn Node.js, which we were using at the time for Runnable, and it gave me a chance to experiment with the Firebase API.</p>

		<p>Copy/paste and share real-time code snippets with others. If you share the url with a friend they will see your code as you type it. As of 2014 CodeShare has 10,000 active monthly users.</p>

	<h2>Runnable</h2>
	<p><a href="http://runnable.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/runnable.jpg" alt="Runnable"></a></p>

		<p>In 2012 I joined Runnable, based in Palo Alto, becoming a member of the founding 5-man team and sole designer. Runnable enables developers to run server-side code in the browser. No downloading, nothing to install, no registration, just run code.</p>

		<p>My daily activities included product discovery, prototyping, user research, interface design, front-end development, integration with Node.js and Javascript and working closely with the engineers and founder.</p>
		<p>As an early stage lean startup, I spent a lot of time running experiments, talking to users and making good use of tools like Mixpanel, Optimizely and Qualaroo to help validate assumptions and determine the product development roadmap, while tackling any design related tasks that needed done.</p>

	<h2>Kareo</h2>
	<p><a href="http://kareo.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/kareo.jpg" alt="Kareo Homepage"></a></p>

		<p>Based in Irvine, Orange County CA, Kareo develop EHR and Practice Management software. I joined as their first design hire, then led the UX Team from 2011-2012 helping them transition from a desktop to web application, and introducing their first iOS app. The company grew from 40 to 200 people during that time.</p>

		<p>Daily activities included product discovery, customer research, prototyping, conducting usability tests, designing and marking up the UI, working closely with developers and product managers while managing the UX team.</p>

	<h2>TwitAmore</h2>
	<div class="group">
	<div class="span6">

	<div class="span6 last">
		<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/twit1.jpg" alt="TwitAmore Viral"></p>
	</div>
	</div>

		<p class="clear">TwitAmore was a side project of mine that went live on Valentine's Day 2012. It's a gimmicky website that tells you who you love on Twitter. I used it as an experiment to improve my Ruby on Rails skills, along with Haml, Sass, using the Twitter API and it was my first project using Heroku as a host.</p>

		<p>Due to the tie in with Valentine's Day the site went viral and managed to get on the front page of <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/02/14/twit-amore/">Mashable</a>, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2013/02/14/having-a-bad-valentines-day-forget-that-and-ask-twitamore-who-you-love-most-on-twitter/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+TheNextWeb+(The+Next+Web+All+Stories)">The Next Web</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/twitamore_n_2689812.html">Huffington Post</a> among others. The site received over 1 million unique visitors in 2012.</p>

		<p>In 2014 I sold TwitAmore to online dating site Dayzee.</p>

	<h2>Lookaly</h2>

		<p>I co-founded Lookaly in 2009 with developer James Gallagher. You could describe Lookaly as Yelp for Northern Ireland. As Creative Director and Co-Founder I was in charge of many things including user experience, branding, product development, marketing, sales and general day to day business operations.</p>
		<p>The site was well received in Northern Ireland attracting over 40 thousand unique visitors per month, and the iPhone app earned us a DANI award in 2011.</p>
		<p>Due to increasing competition in this space I closed Lookaly in 2014.</p>

	<h2>The Big Word Project</h2>

		<p>While at University I teamed up with classmate Paddy Donnelly and created a website that let people buy words of the dictionary, priced at $1 per letter, and link them to their website.</p>
		<p>It was a viral success. We managed to sell over 7,500 words, with endorsements from the likes of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/02/27/big-word-project">John Gruber</a>, and it led to a feature article in <a href="http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-05/st_alpha">Wired magazine</a>, April 2008.</p>
